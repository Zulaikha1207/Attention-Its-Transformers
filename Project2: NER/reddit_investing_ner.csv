There is very little doubt that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have made factors and indexes more  
accessible  to market participants. One of the key design innovations of ETFs is  the implementation of an explicit arbitrage mechanism called **creation-redemption**  that makes an ETF and its underlying portfolio fungible. This arbitrage  mechanism ensures that, at least for ETFs holding liquid securities,  opportunistic arbitrageurs will keep an ETF’s price and net asset value  (NAV) aligned since deviations lead to profitable, essentially riskless  trading opportunities. Upon observing this riskless trading opportunity, arbitrageurs  act to capture profits by trading in the underlying portfolio until the  discrepancy between price and NAV is eliminated.

How do they do it? They capture risk-less profits by trading each  constituent security based on its portfolio weight since that is the  only way to obtain the fungible unit and utilize the risk-less arbitrage  mechanism in ETFs.

Abstract:   
I argue that arbitrage mistranslates factor information from ETFs to  constituent securities and distorts comovement. The intuition behind  this distortion is arbitrageurs trade constituent securities not based  on their fundamental exposures but by their portfolio weights, causing  securities to comove with the ETF based on a measure I call arbitrage  sensitivity — a combination of portfolio weight and price impact  sensitivity — rather than fundamental exposures. Arbitrage sensitivity  predicts comovement between stock and ETF returns, especially in periods  of high ETF volume and volatility, but not before 2008 when ETFs were  not as heavily traded. Arbitrage-induced comovement leads to  over-reaction to ETF returns for stocks more sensitive to arbitrage and  under-reaction for those less sensitive. A long-short portfolio  constructed based on arbitrage sensitivity generates an alpha of around  7.5% per year. Unlike most anomalies, arbitrage comovement is strongest  in large-cap stocks, which are held by the most actively traded ETFs.  Arbitrage comovement implies observed factor loadings are less reliable  for assessing risk since they are at least partially driven by  mechanical arbitrage trading instead of fundamental exposures."|0.5|0|0|0|[]

This would have had significant implications considering the prevailing trends and behaviors in the financial landscape.

Currently, individuals have grown accustomed to receiving financial aid easily and having convenient access to funds. Moreover, they have become accustomed to witnessing unpredictable changes in the market. Consequently, there is a tendency to heavily rely on quotes from influential investors like Warren Buffet with either loose or uncorrelated contexts. Unfortunately, this often leads to insufficient attention being paid to investment risks, market fluctuations, and the true value of their investments. People tend to utilize various tools and information that reinforce their existing beliefs, potentially exacerbating the issue.

Given this context, it becomes clear that a substantial negative event would be necessary to instill fear in shareholders and prompt them to reconsider their investment strategies. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of contemporary manifestations of hazardous overconfidence. These include the idea that despite being susceptible to reckless interference, the global economy cannot be fundamentally dismantled. Additionally, there is a notion that the stability of US political institutions is inherently bestowed and everlasting. Lastly, some individuals believe that moral absolutism, which dismisses opposing perspectives as perpetually foolish or driven by deceitful motives and self-centeredness, is the optimal means of upholding democracy and freedom.

A significant aspect that has influenced the financial landscape is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision to permit companies to repurchase their own stocks. As a result, companies have the ability to extract funds from investors without providing dividends until the company fails. Importantly, it is crucial to note that companies are not legally obligated to fulfill these promises, but they are rather legally encouraged to make them as a part of their strategic approach. This has implications for investors and shareholders alike

t3_13qaumj|1684902138.0|investing|Who will buy the $1 trillion of new bills flooding the market before the end of August?|"**A debt-ceiling deal will spark a new worry: Who will buy the deluge of Treasury bills?**

When the U.S. debt-ceiling fight finally is resolved, the Treasury is expected to unleash a flood of bill issuance to help refill its coffers run low by the protracted standoff in Washington, D.C., over the government’s borrowing limit.

The question is, who will buy them and at what price?

Treasury bills are debt issued by the U.S. government that mature in four to 52 weeks. New bill issuance could reach about $1.4 trillion through the end of 2023, with roughly $1 trillion flooding the market before the end of August, according to an estimate from BofA Global strategists.

They expect the deluge through August to be about five times the supply of an average three-month stretch in years before the pandemic.

“The good news is that we have a high degree of confidence around who is going to buy it,” said Mark Cabana, rates strategist at BofA Global, in a phone interview with MarketWatch. “The bad news is that it’s not going to be at current levels. Things have to cheapen.”

Cabana sees a key buyer of bill supply unleashed by a debt-ceiling deal in money-market funds, which have climbed to nearly $5.4 trillion in assets managed since the regional banking crisis erupted in March (see chart).

So people who yanked billions of dollars in deposits from banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March and parked them in money-market funds could end up playing an encore performance in this year’s debt-ceiling drama.

&amp;#x200B;

**$2 trillion at Fed repo facility**

Money-market funds have been the main reason why at least $2 trillion consistently sits overnight at the Federal Reserve’s reverse repo facility. The program was last offering a roughly 5% rate, a level Cabana said new Treasury bills might need to exceed by about 10-20 basis points.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s an unintended consequence of a debt-ceiling deal getting done,” said George Catrambone, head of fixed income Americas at DWS Group, about market expectations for heavy short-term Treasury bill issuance, but he also expects money-market funds, foreign buyers and other institutions auctions to continue as buyers in the market.

MarketWatch on Multiple devices

“There’s always buyers. It’s a question of price.”

President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. met Monday to talk about potential ways to raise the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit and to avoid a “doomsday” scenario in financial markets if the U.S. defaults.Congress has struck deals each time U.S. public debt has exceeded its debt ceiling in the past, including by suspending it eight times since 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

That doesn’t mean financial markets sit by idly. The 1-month Treasury yield TMUBMUSD01M, 5.516% rose to almost 5.6% on Tuesday, while the 3-month yield TMUBMUSD03M, 5.287% was 5.3%, according to FactSet. Bill maturing around the “X-date,” which could come as soon as June 1, have even higher yields.Read: Debt-ceiling angst sends Treasury bill yields toward 6%

&amp;#x200B;

“Those are obviously pretty heady yields,” Catrambone said. “But it also exemplifies the market having to price in potential market disruptions in the month of June,” even though his team, like many in financial markets, expect that eventually “cooler heads will prevail” in Washington as the debt-ceiling standoff heads down to the wire.

&amp;#x200B;

**How the money ran out**

The Treasury in January hit its borrowing limit and began operating under “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default.

Cash balances at the Treasury Department have since dwindled to less than $100 billion, according to economists at Jefferies. Barclays strategists estimate its cash balance may fall below $50 billion between June 5-15.

“Basically, we are just draining our cash account to fund operations while we wait to figure out the debt ceiling,” said Lindsay Rosner, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income.

But when the battle over the debt limit ends in a resolution, she expects longer-dated Treasury yields to increase, as haven buying on fears of potentially a full U.S. government default and a credit rating downgrade will have been taken off the table.

“The Armageddon, whatever small probability people were pricing in of catastrophe, remove that,” she said. “And that means the worst economic outcome has been removed.”

That’s also a reason why Rosner has been avoiding ultrashort Treasurys in the eye of the debt-ceiling fight in favor of 2, 3 or 4-year bonds offering some of the highest yields in years.

“We’re being afforded good yield, good spread, a couple of years out the curve,” she said. “Play that game.”

I am subject to a trading window that happens to be within 30 days oof the vest dates so any sales I do in this account are always considered wash sales, since I can only transact so close to the vest date.  


I currently have a few lots some with losses and some with gains (these are all same stock) and wanted to sell some of them to diversify. I am worried about not being able to offset taxes with the lots that have losses because of wash sale.  


From what I understand if I sell the lots that have the loss because it is a wash sale the loss will instead by added as cost basis for future transactions. However I will not ever do a buy transaction in this account so there won't be much to add the cost basis too.   


Here are some options I came up with depending on the interpretation of the tax setup:  


1. Assuming the cost basis will also be adjusted for subsequent sell. I would sell the loss stocks, get the disallowed loss. The next day I would sell the other lot that has gains and hopefully Schwab figures it out and adjust the cost basis for that sale. This is logical to be but I see no confirmation it actually works this way.
2. I see only the loss stocks and get the disallowed loss. On the next RSU vest Schwab will adjust the cost basis of new shares (technically it is a buy) with the loss. Also not sure it works with RSU vests.
3. I should only sell the stocks that have gains to avoid wasting losses, and only sell the loss stocks after I leave the company. This sounds like a really bad option."|0.63|7|0|7|[]

This is a ways out, but it bears consideration.  

I'm curious if you have any ideas what you might be able to use a Longterm Care for if it needs to stop functioning as an LTC. I think a small retrofit would work for a minimum security prison, pretty posh student accommodations, or psychiatric hospital. Presently they value their property and equipment at the greater of the projected net proceeds of sale or its value in use, and while the auditors have employed real estate consultants to assess the value of the net proceeds of sale, I wouldn't mind ideas about what alternatives uses they might have that could impact the sale price.  

It's funny, but while people have talked a lot about a demographic boom in LTC demand, eventually that demand will fall again and then we're going to be left with excess properties that have been customized to LTC use. Maybe my idea of funny is a bit off here, though. Also, prudential management will allow the properties to degrade significantly on the tail end of that demand trajectory, which would further impact the value of said properties.

(As an aside, I don't want to say demand curve here because I'm looking at it as a stock chart over time not a demand per price or something... what's the correct term for what I'm looking for? I chose trajectory for clarity but if there's a proper term I would love to hear it.)"|0.48|0|0|0|[]

I wasn't a fan of the constant referencing to his Investor's Business Daily service, which seemed to steadily increase over the course of the book until it felt like I was reading marketing material in the final chapters - the cynical side of me would say the book is designed to hook you in as a ""DIY"" investing system, only to make subscribing to IBD an essential part of the process by the end.

However, I thought his CANSLIM system made a certain amount of sense, and sounded like a reasonable set of rules for some play money investing (my primary investment is long term index tracking).

I did finally relent and take the bait, and recently signed up for the IBD Digital trial. I'm actually quite impressed by the content and analysis, but one thing struck me as a little concerning. It has a section called the ""IBD 50"", described as ""IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks gives you 50 companies showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals"". Basically the top 50 stocks most conforming with the CANSLIM system at that moment in time, and I presume updated daily.

I also saw that there is an ETF to track the IBD 50, Innovator Capital Management's IBD 50 ETF (FFTY). So I was a little surprised to see how poorly it's performed... 1 Year -20%, 3 year -8%, 5 year -7.48% ([https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-comparison/VOO-vs-FFTY](https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-comparison/VOO-vs-FFTY)).

Does that blow the CANSLIM system out of the water, or is this a poor way to judge the effectiveness of the system?

I know the CANSLIM system is heavily reliant on entering and exiting a position at the right time, attempting to capitalise on explosive growth, so maybe an ETF tracking the stocks that simply conform to the IBD ""checklist"" doesn't take this into account, holding the stocks well beyond their CANSLIM sell point. Still, I'm finding it worrying that a group of 50 stocks that apparently are absolute best in class could perform so poorly as an ETF."|0.73|5|0|5|[]

I am very much into managing and being on top of my finances, but I am far from a savvy investor.  After playing around with stocks where I just buy companies I know and like, and rely on analysts input I am moving away from that as it has not worked out well.

Currently, I have a Betterment account with a 70% stock 30% bond portfolio and I created an etrade 3 fund portfolio based on vanguard etf's.

Pro's for etrade is I can see real time updates.  I am not tinkering or playing as I know you need to leave it but I like seeing how I am doing.  I also get more control and no fees.  Con's are I have to stay on top of rebalancing, and I cannot buy fractional shares without the automatic investment on which means I cannot rebalance through deposits.

for Betterment it is obviously set it and forget it.  On top of the rebalancing I know they say they do tax harvesting.  It is certainly a bit more boring lol, but I am sure works.  Biggest downside is the updated balance doesnt post until next day which again for a set and forget it is fine but I like seeing it.  And they charge a 0.25 % fee.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is....  Does the tax harvesting and rebalancing pay off the 0.25% fee or is it more cost efficient to manage myself (which means I wont do tax harvesting as I wouldnt know how to myself).

* After doing some research on early-stage private investing I feel most capital gains happen in that space, as it's a high-risk high reward game.  I looked into getting into that space through Forge marketplace, but you need to be an accredited investor (min net worth of 1 million USD, or 300k annual salary) which I believe is such a high barrier of entry and as you expect I don't qualify. Curious why this criteria is put in the first place by SEC? Is it to make private investing accessible only for rich people, not surprised though as we live in a capitalistic environment. Is there any legal loophole around this criteria. The frustrating part is I have the capital and I have 5-7 private companies to invest in my watchlist, but I am not allowed to invest.


* I have invested in some private companies through crowd investing portal like Wefunder, but not all the promising companies come on such platform to raise funding.

- Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, is moving out of US assets in favor of China.
- The move is motivated by China's brighter economic prospects, better valuations, and a more benign outlook for inflation.
- Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of Amundi, believes that too much risk is priced into Chinese credit and high-quality companies, while markets in the US are ""too optimistic"" as a recession looms.
- Mortier predicts that the US economy will not grow next year, while China, India, and Indonesia will each grow by 5 to 6 percent.
- Despite recent political tensions and disappointing economic data, Amundi is optimistic about China and has been gradually increasing its allocation to China and India over the past 12 months.
- Mortier is particularly keen on opportunities in select Chinese corporate bonds, arguing that foreign investors have been blanket selling without differentiating between the quality of issuers.
- US markets are pricing in a ""goldilocks"" scenario of low inflation, rate cuts, stronger earnings, and a soft landing, which Mortier thinks is becoming increasingly remote as financial conditions tighten.
- Mortier thinks inflation in both the US and Europe will stabilize at around 3 to 4 percent in the years ahead, with some volatility that will make the Fed's job particularly difficult.
- However, Mortier is not worried about the possibility of a US debt default."|0.78|130|0|130|[]

I'm reaching out to make sure I'm on the right track, and that I have some decent reasoning behind my selections considering I don't have much experience investing at all.

I started the account when she was 3, she's now 4.5, so this account should go to her in about 13.5 years.  I've tried to select mostly mutual funds since these come with a number of individual stocks, so essentially a pre-built diversified portfolio.  I have selected the following mutual funds:

FSMEX: There's always medical advances and research, medical seems like it should grow over time.  Therefore, I am currently down on this one by 20%

FSPTX: Technology continues to develop, this should be fairly safe.  Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing are here and will likely change the world.  Therefore, I am down 10%.

FSELX: It seems like Semiconductors are in everything electronic, and there are plans to bring some of that manufacturing to the United States.  This one is up 3%.

FSLEX: Environmental technology and energy is going to become more important as climate change continues.  Besides which, I want a cleaner/greener world for the kiddo, and I think it's important to invest in your values.  This one is up 5%.



Fidelity tells me this is an aggressive growth mix.  I'm interrupting this as meaning that barring any oddly catastrophic situations this portfolio should grow very well over the next 13 years.  

So far, this basic reasoning seems to make sense to me, but I'm a novice and if there is anything I'm wrong about, I'd like to know now.

Example: like does Amazon, $AMZN, have a software that’s given to them from the NASDAQ that shows their stock price chart, volume, EMA, maybe some more things for them to see chart related. Then they can see their constantly changing market cap and P/E ratio. They can see documents filed by the company, investor’s filings, articles from authors including themselves listed on there. Do they see banks and or the Fed pushing them loans, interest rates, and terms on a table chart that they can choose from? Or is it just companies call up a bank they want and talk to them about a loan? I know people fund their market cap but the company can’t just go and sell their shares constantly, so they keep their shares and give them to their employees, and also buy them back. Then they can push up cash/ shares to borrow against and get back those shares once they pay off the loan or do their shares not ever go to the bank and are held? The ladder? Do they have their live account balances in terms of their cash and asset holdings debt to these banks?

The more the market cap and the higher P/E ratio the more the people believe in the company and want to fund them. So, the company has access to more cash, can get better rates and terms from banks pushing them loans to choose from.

The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

t3_13l5gc0|1684431597.0|investing|[D] The Question facing Nvidia|"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.

The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.

Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.

I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.

The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?

I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.

So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.  

Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.

What about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as "" AI is their number 1 priority.""  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.

A ""real"" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.   

Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another ""AI winter"" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context."|0.84|89|0|89|[]

t3_13l4l6b|1684429499.0|investing|Gold has broken out of its corridor|"For nearly two months, it traded within the range of **$1975-2050**. Support at its lower boundary held off a price decline in the latter half of April, but it couldn't hold up this time.

Prices have dipped below that range, now breaching the 50-day average.

The reasons are apparent. Optimism about the debt ceiling, plus upward movement in the dollar and other risk assets can only mean one thing: a corresponding downturn for gold.

**So where might the drop stop?**

This morning, Lorie K. Logan gave an additional boost to the dollar, adding to the uncertainty about just how far gold could fall. The next halt could be at $1950, where the price would meet the ascending trendline from November. By early June, the 100-day average will likely reach the same point. At that poing, you could speculatively buy a bit of **GLD** or **JNUG**.

But be cautious with the volume, as a breach of the trend could quickly drive prices down to $1900 or even lower. If that happens, it would be a good opportunity to buy more substantively, as **I see gold substantially above $2000 in the long term**.

If gold quickly returns to its range, it will likely rebound to $2010-2020. But as always, further movements will depend on the developing situation.

Even if there's no immediate need to hedge against a default, inflation risks remain. Having some gold still won't hurt."|0.41|0|0|0|[]

My biggest concern wouldn't be losing my principle, I don't think that would happen. But with all of the current high rates, having a large chunk of money tied up in an investment that wouldn't end up being fruitful in the end, would be a huge **opportunity cost**.

He's suggested parking approximately 1/3 into this no-fee [Athene 6-year RILA](https://www.athene.com/cs/amplify2nf-rates).  I'm told in a nutshell it is linked to the S&amp;P 500, if it goes up 50% in 6 years I'll get back the principal + 50% plus a 20% participation bonus (on the gains only, iirc), with no cap.  Has a downside protection of 10% should it be within -10% loss in 6 years i would still get the principal back in full (not sure if with the participation bonus?).  Lower than that would incur losses with the market.

It sounds good and a pretty safe place for a large portion, and a long enough term that I expect the market to not be lower at that point.  Unfortunately its locked away for 6 years.  However, the advisor said it doesn't count in the investment yearly fee since its technically not being managed for that period of time, which is another bonus.

I just want to be sure I'm not missing anything, downsides/cons that aren't in the documentation, or only those with know-how are aware of, tax implications, or just another similar but better way to get those kinds of returns/safety.

Capcom had its best financial year ever by selling more games than any other previous year in its history. This was the sixth consecutive year in which the company managed to sell even more games than before, thanks to a few big hitters and a huge catalog with many excellent remakes of famous Capcom franchises.

The Japanese game developer and publisher had a great financial year in 2022, despite not releasing many titles. The company’s fiscal year, which started in April 2022 and ended in March 2023, saw the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake, which got excellent reviews, and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, an expansion DLC for the original game.

Capcom recently revealed, via its financial reports for 2022, that it sold 41.7 million games in its fiscal year. As originally spotted by VGC, the company was able to beat its own records for the sixth year in a row, growing from the 32.6 games sold in the previous year. The sales were led by two games released within the year: Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which managed to sell 5.45 million units, and Resident Evil 4, which was only out for a few days before the fiscal year ended but still sold an amazing number of 3.75 million units. According to Capcom, most of the sales came from other, older games, including the original Monster Hunter Rise (3.7 million units), Resident Evil 2 (2.25 million), and Resident Evil 3 (1.95 million).

The good financial results also impacted Capcom’s shares, which are being sold at 5,270 Japanese Yen (JPY) at the time of this report. As a comparison, they were at around 3,300 JPY a year ago, and 1,300 JPY five years ago, showing just how meteoric the company’s financial rise has been. It’s definitely a far cry from the time when the company released Resident Evil 6, for instance, often considered one of the worst entries in the Resident Evil franchise.

Players may be wondering how Capcom intends to top its own records in the future. The answer, it seems, could be on rebooting the Dead Rising franchise. According to recent rumors, the Japanese game developer may be working on bringing back the series. However, this was not confirmed officially so far. Obviously, Resident Evil 4 was also released at the end of the fiscal year and it was a huge hit, so it will probably appear as one of the top-sellers, too, and Street Fighter 6 is just around the corner, promising even more sales."|0.56|2|0|2|['Capcom']
t3_13k6drk|1684340305.0|investing|Bank CD interests vs Stock Market|"If banks are offering higher CD interest rates to consumers, I assume banks use the funds they receive from consumers to either lend out to other consumers as loans with higher interest rates or use the funds to invest in the stock market in hopes of higher returns than the CD interest rate they are paying out. Also assuming the higher CD interest rate is because of the higher fed fund rate. 

Not being too educated in this subject, should I assume if the banks are willing to give out higher CD interest rates than normal, does that mean we can expect the stock market to trend upwards where in general we could receive higher yields than the CD rates offered by the bank as a sign? 

Assuming and knowing that the stock market is much more volatile than a CD where it's backed up to a certain amount by the government etc. 

But in the general sense, can we assume a bullish stock market if banks are incentivizing consumers to deposit money through them by advertising highish CD interest rates?

In the context of time using now, CD interest rates seems to be climbing slowly upwards and seems to be near the highs in the last 20-30 years. I just hear we are not bottomed out yet in the recession but just couldn't make sense why banks would offer higher CD interest rates if they didn't see an opportunity to reinvest those funds for potential higher yields in other markets, specifically the stock market. I'm sure some would go towards giving out loans for higher interests to consumers but I assume definitely not all. Just trying to understand the overall logic.

If you could kindly explain in the sense that I don't have too much knowledge in this field, that would help me understand your answers better."|0.62|4|0|4|[]

This hypothetical strategy has  realized consistently attractive risk-adjusted returns over a 50+ year  sample, and performance is pervasive across both markets and measures.  It exhibits low correlation to traditional risk premia on average and  tends to perform exceptionally well during drawdown periods for  traditional asset classes. While economic trend is a close relative of  price trend-following—both approaches aim to capitalize on the tendency  of markets to systematically under-react to news—the two strategies are  highly complementary. Combining the two leads to improved risk-adjusted  performance and more robust drawdown protection than price  trend-following alone.

* The forecast for the platinum deficit in 2023 has been revised upward by 77% to 983 koz, with demand increasing by 28% and supply decreasing by 1% year-on-year. 
* Stronger-than-anticipated positive investment demand in the first quarter has led to an increased full-year forecast of 433 koz. 
* Industrial demand is projected to hit a record high, increasing 17% as a result of glass production expansions in China. 
* Strong platinum demand growth in the automotive sector is set to continue in 2023, with a projected rise of 12%.

**What's noteworthy?**

WPIC believes that an economic slowdown will not hinder new record highs in industrial demand. As usual, China is expected to be of a major contributing factor thanks to a rise in its demand for chemicals and demand and expansions in LCD glass capacity.

The equally strong demand for platinum in the automotive sector is partly based on increased vehicle production, but is primarily the result of the increased amount of platinum per vehicle produced. HDV production in China is estimated to jump 26%, while stricter emissions legislation will result in higher loadings.

WPIC's estimates are undoubtedly realistic. However, a lot could go wrong. If reality turns out to be slightly less rosy, we can forget about a surge in investment demand.

This is precisely what happened in 2022. A year ago, WPIC was expecting a +104 koz increase for 2022. The final result was -640 koz. Since investment demand is the most volatile, it often has the most significant impact on prices.

It was the outflow of funds from platinum ETFs that caused the price to slump below $850 last summer.

However, even if history repeats itself this year, the dip won't be long-lasting. Unlike palladium, which is almost 90% dependent on automotive demand, platinum demand is more diversified, and its role in green energy will provide long-term support.

I'm holding PPLT in my portfolio because $1100 for platinum is certainly not the limit."|0.73|29|0|29|[]

I currently have about 80k in a 401(a) account to which only my employer contributes (I cannot). This is currently with Fidelity. As of now, I have the money distributed among 7 different investments (FXAIX, FTIHX, VWNAX, GCSIX, FFFHX, Principal Diversified Real Asset CIT Tier 1, MADCX). For reference, these were investments I chose when I first started with the company about 10 years ago, so there was no real rhyme or reason to the initial choices, save for some minor research about the funds offered by this particular plan (which only offered a few options). 

What I would like to do is roll these funds over into the FZROX/FZILX funds and just found out that I can with Fidelity's Brokeragelink.

t3_13i3cne|1684143415.0|investing|Let us brew bucks with precision fermentation... but how?|"Are you hungry too? I am, as always.

I want to discuss a topic that has been increasingly getting attention in the food tech sector – **precision fermentation**.

In its essence, precision fermentation is a technology that brews food in large fermentation chambers. It's not a new concept – if you appreciate a good brew, you might already be familiar with it. This technology can create a variety of foods, from dairy and honey to meat alternatives, which is what's making it increasingly significant.

My excitement comes from the potential of this technology to produce high-quality, cost-effective proteins that could be superior to their animal-based equivalents. The ultimate goal is to reduce our dependency on animals as a primary food source.

Considering the predictions that our food production must double by 2050 to cater to nearly 10 billion people, traditional methods might not suffice. That's where precision fermentation steps in. RethinkX, an independent think tank, suggests that U.S. beef and dairy production might decline by more than 50% by 2030 and nearly 90% by 2035. However, they expect alternatives created by precision fermentation to cost between 50% and 80% less than the animal products they replace.

Moreover, precision fermentation might also bring numerous environmental benefits by using less land, feedstock, and water resources.

Investors have caught onto the potential. Companies in this sector raised $911 million in venture capital in just the first quarter of this year, with fermentation companies pulling in $290 million of that. Since 2010, fermentation-derived meat, seafood, egg, and dairy companies have raised over $3 billion.

The precision fermentation market size is projected to grow exponentially, from $1.6 billion in 2022 to an estimated $36.3 billion by 2030. So: \***22.7**. This growth will be driven by a lower carbon footprint and a surge in the production of precision-fermented ingredients.

Given all this, it's clear that precision fermentation is not just a trend – it is the future of food production. But that leaves us with the million-dollar question (quite literally, if you play your cards right):

**Does anyone know how smaller investors like ourselves can invest in these companies?**

And are there companies on the stock market that you're already following or investing in?

Let's be honest, who wouldn't want to make a bit of money while contributing to a sustainable future? It's a win-win if you ask me. (Or potentially lose a heap of money for a good cause, which, to be honest, is more my style of investing...)

So, let's hear your thoughts! How can we invest in precision fermentation and make both our wallets and our consciences a bit heavier?

Thank you for your time.

My fiancé (35) is considering transferring the majority of her retirement funds from Fidelity to Empower.  
Empower is her current employer 401K.  There is around $9K in that account.  
Currently she has a rollover IRA (rolled over last year from a prior employer) as well as a Roth IRA  with Fidelity.  Here is the breakdown of those accounts  -  
Rollover IRA –  
79,839.18 in cash

A random $800 from an older 401K that needs to be rolled over.  
The main question she is wondering if she should roll both Fidelity accounts into the Empower My Total Retirement program.  She had a meeting with them and they said that if she did there would be no advisory fee.  The plan documents for their 401K say there is a quarterly fee of 0.1125%.  The Premier Retirement Advisory services has a fee of 0.50%/year plus another 0.4% for the next 150K.She is looking for some input on a few questions –   
1)	Is the my total retirement annual the same as the advisory fee they said they would waive?   
2)	Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell even if the advisory is managing the transactions?  There seems to be charges for each transaction in her 401K and she is currently signed up for the My Total Retirement Program.  
3)	I think she would need to liquidate the Fidelity zero funds if she moved to Empower and that would be a taxable event.  Is that accurate?  
4)	Most importantly, would it be worth it to move the Fidelity funds to Empower and have them manage it?  And if it is not worth it, should she stop the My Total Retirement program at Empower to save on fees and just keep running the self directed 401K?  
My idea with recommending the Fidelity funds to her initially was the zero expense ratio for some of the funds above.

In there, he outlined the 4 filters he uses when looking at ideas to optimize his Return on Time. The goal is to find a reason to say no as fast as possible so here is how he gets there  
1) Find a Write up on Value Investors Club- There is a higher quality filter here and it is something he can read quickly to get up to speed.  
2) Read Managment Letters, Only if Written by Managment-Stay away from letters put together by PR firms and only focus on the companies where the CEO writes a straightforward letter.  
3) Q&amp;A from Transcripts- Wants to see how management reacts when they are put on the spot.  
4) Moves Onto Company Filings - If the company passes all of the filters above then he moves on to the company documents

Would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this. I really like the VIC filter, it probably saves him so much time."|0.61|35|0|35|[]

The company reported sales of TWD 92 billion and net income of TWD 5.8 billion for 2022, with an EPS of TWD 15.51 and a dividend of TWD 4.72 per share.

The company has a market cap of TWD 72.5 billion, a P/E ratio of 15 times, a dividend yield of 2.55% and a growth rate of 11%. The company could be a value play because it has a low P/E ratio compared to its growth rate and industry average, a stable dividend policy and a strong brand reputation. I think 8-15x PE would be a good pick

The company faces some risks such as:

* Competition from other bicycle brands and alternative modes of transportation,


* Fluctuation in raw material costs and exchange rates,


* Environmental and social regulations and consumer preferences.


Overall, I believe Giant Manufacturing is a good value pick for investors looking for a company with a strong track record of growth, a stable dividend policy and a low valuation.

Can the information gained from previous failures be used to determine the probability of the next failure and/or identify which bank it will be? Or is that primarily private information released in quarterly reports.

Was wondering about this idea for a good while.

Here what i got

|MEDIAN|37.99|89.82|
|QUARTILE 2|46.92|105.40|
|MAX|55.91|150.24|

In term of volatility, both stocks has the same volatility, it means that if you bouth only INTC or only AMD of both together some day randomly in the 2022, you will more or less get the same return, probably somewhere near the negative rate.

|VAR. COEFFICIENT|23.15%|23.33%|

the coefficent of variance is used to compare two data set that has different measurements or scale, and it is used to compare their standard deviation.

Standard deviantion alone tells us that ADM is more volatile than INTC, but refining the data we can see that they are the same

t3_13fckts|1683871710.0|investing|The Current State of the U.S Economy: Inflation, Unemployment and the Future of Fed Decisions|"Recent reports indicate a notable shift in the U.S. economic climate, painting a picture of an economy that's slowing and disinflating. After two consecutive months of declining shelter inflation, we have seen a significant drop in the producer price index (PPI). Core PPI has plunged from 10% to 3% in just over a year, signaling a trend of ""peak inflation data"" continuing to be observed, as noted by Don Rissmiller of Strategas.

The labor market, however, seems to be weakening with an uptick in unemployment insurance claims this year. While the economy is slowing and disinflation is underway, the unemployment rate is still relatively low at 3.4%. This suggests that the Fed's actions so far might be sufficient to control inflation without significantly increasing unemployment.

However, the economy's reliance on the U.S. consumer makes it vulnerable. If the labor market continues to weaken, economic growth could take a hit, and we may see more economic difficulties as we reach the apex of a tightening cycle. This could force the Fed into hard choices about rate adjustments.

Mr. Futures Market predicts a 25bp cut in September and three cuts by the year's end, but opinions are divided. Some believe that the Fed's continued tightening could lead us into a recession, while others think that economic deceleration will necessitate rate cuts later in the year.

In another corner of the economic landscape, the contrasting financial performance of Uber and Airbnb — two companies with similar business models but very different profitability — raises interesting questions. Despite a shared business model of facilitating rentals (cars for Uber, homes for Airbnb), and similar enterprise values, Uber has been burning cash while Airbnb has generated $2.8bn of true free cash in the past four quarters.

One tentative theory for this discrepancy is that Uber, despite its larger scale, has chosen to invest more aggressively than Airbnb, sacrificing short-term profits for long-term gains. There is also the matter of significant differences in gross profit margins, possibly influenced by insurance costs.

These are fascinating economic narratives to follow. I invite all of you to share your thoughts on these matters. How do you see the Fed's decisions shaping up in the face of these economic trends? What's your take on the divergent profitability of Uber and Airbnb?"|0.63|8|0|8|[]
t3_13fbba2|1683867545.0|investing|Is a potential breakthrough in AI research/application going to be reflected in S&amp;P 500?|"With AI being the new hot topic out there, we see so many companies investing a lot of resources in R&amp;D hoping for a big breakthrough. While it is normal to see emerging companies being innovative and investors looking for opportunities, it can also be seen that companies such as MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN are heavily invested into the idea, particularly MSFT with its continuous investment into OpenAI.

I don't see AI being an investment fad, for a lack of a better term, like it can be argued that blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFTs were at some point. With that, I am mostly referring to ordinary investors that would invest in such assets on a long-term basis rather than traders looking for large returns with any of the financial instruments at their disposal.

Given the fact that the companies mentioned above already represent a fair share of the S&amp;P 500 index, is it safe to assume that any potential global breakthrough in AI is going to affect the value of any relevant ETFs since we do not know which of those major companies is going to be the first/best to reap the benefits of AI? Or the more risky approach of picking stocks like MSFT and emerging companies is more likely to be more profitable?

Some may argue that a breakthrough in AI R&amp;D is imminent but that it might actually result in a dot-com bubble-like crash because the current market prices have already factored in the expectation of larger returns which may or may not actually happen with AI.

In a nutshell, can S&amp;P 500 ETF investing reap the benefits of a potential AI revolution or investors still have to take the risk and pick individual stocks? Can a crash of S&amp;P 500 value be expected because some sectors could potentially lose value with AI or the prices are already too ambitious with some expectations on AI?"|0.2|0|0|0|[]

Well, I would personally gravitate to the most beaten down names. During COVID I did OVV CEIX and ARLP which was madly stressful to have all my money in. I reasoned if 2 failed one of them would make up the Ballance ;)

So what do you do?

Do you buy a basket of banks instead of three tickers like I did?

Which do you choose? 

Maybe you build a scan, filter only regionals down X% and then look into their ballance sheets to come up with an approximation of default probability.


Or; you can buy DPST. The triple is down from 66 to 4 (keep in mind decay exists) where as individual bank stocks which have a very reasonable probability of default have fallen less, PACW 50~ to 4.8.

Actual magic. What an asset class these triples are. If I had heard of NRGU during COVID I'd have slept a lot better lmao.

Just putting the thought forward. Triple ETFs for the lazy but aggressive speculator probably carry the same doubling capacity as a stock like PACW but literally 1/30th the risk..

Read about triples before you buy them. Don't be an idiot. But consider the risk to reward proposition and watch to see how it plays out in real life for next time.

As I understand it, when doing a DCF analysis of an investment, we usually don't take into account debt in the FCF but rather discount at a rate that takes into account the cost of debt: the WACC.

For a real estate deal, this would look something like this: [https://imgur.com/a/n9eZbGR](https://imgur.com/a/n9eZbGR)

In this easy example, given the rental level, the expected exit price and the required returns, the value of the asset (i.e. NPV =0) is calculated to be 8.341 m€.

However, if I calculate the same investment opportunity but I take into account the loan into the cash flow computation and then discount using the required return on equity, then the asset is worth less (or at the same price, my NPV is &lt; 0). [https://imgur.com/a/b6ZVvvn](https://imgur.com/a/b6ZVvvn)

I thought that these calculation methods were suppose to return the same result?

Google killed it yesterday at the conference.

Google could become the leading ""trustworthy"" AI company everyone is looking at. I was a little worried about this Zuckertard 2.0 named Sam Altman, who talks like a freaking robot and who the hell knows what he's doing with your data (yeah, you haven't read his terms when you signed up). None of his back and forth podcasts in the last few months convinced me, more like made him suspicious.

Sundra Pichai said yesterday that Google will meta tag all AI-created images from day 1, including a nice watermark on them. Also, it launched a fact check tool to find out if the content or news is misleading or not (the big concern with all this AI boom)

I have already seen a few dangerous applications our there. For example some people on LinkedIn happy with many new releases that are illegal under the Data Privacy Act. Things like you can use an AI website where you put a name and it gives you a lot of social media information about this person, or prompt the AI the profile you need to recruit and it will pull up a lot of profiles with photos, information from career, social media information of candidates who are suitable, with their email addresses. I never authorized my profile to be on these AI sites other than LinkedIn (which I kept private and visible only to HR profiles), and now my profile, picture, and info. 

Google will become the voice politicians, regulators and society is looking at. Beucaseu they are in the business since the late 90's. They know what regulations means. They went through a lot of issues, solved them and survived.

Primary takeaways -

* Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in Q2 2023, marking its second consecutive quarterly drop.
* However, the company narrowed its streaming business losses by $400 million YoY.
* The sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia.
* In the US/Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subscribers while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.
* Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.
* Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”
* Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”
* Disney’s Parks, Experiences and Products group saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion.
* The company's Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion.
* Disney's content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.
* Disney+ shed another 4 million subscribers in the first three months of 2023, marking the streamer’s second consecutive quarterly drop after closing 2022 with its first-ever decline. On the bright side, the Mouse House also managed to narrow its streaming business losses by $400 million, down 26% year over year.

On Wednesday, CEO Bob Iger and Co. beat Wall Street estimates for Disney’s quarterly earnings and revenue due to an impressive January-March showing at the company’s theme parks. That win comes during a fiscal Q2, which concluded April 1, plagued by company-wide layoffs, a looming (and now active) writers strike and a turf war with Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis.

Disney ended the quarter with 157.8 million subscribers at Disney+, significantly missing Wall Street’s estimate of 163.17 million subs. That projected figured would have been up from the 161.8 million subs Disney+ fell to the prior quarter.

This second sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, Disney lost streaming rights to Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches, which prompted it to lower growth targets for Disney+ Hotstar in India.

In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subs (to reach 46.3 million), while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.

Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.

During Disney’s earnings call with analysts later Wednesday, Iger — who returned to his post as CEO last fall upon the ousting of Bob Chapek — announced that Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a “one-app experience.”

Also on the call, CFO Christine McCarthy announced Disney is “in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation” and “will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.”

According to McCarthy, Disney expects a writedown in Q3 of $1.5-$1.8 billion from removing the content. McCarthy also said “going forward we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.”

The content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.

Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents on $21.78 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by Refinitiv. Disney reported adjusted EPS of 93 cents on $21.82 billion in revenue.

Disney posted negative free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter.

Starting with its fiscal Q2 2022, Disney restructured its financial results into two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion — which was better than analysts forecasted.

At Disney’s linear TV networks, revenue dropped 7% to $6.6 billion, and operating income decreased 35% to $1.8 billion.

Revenue for Disney’s domestic TV channels business, which include ABC and ESPN, decreased 4% to $5.6 billion and operating income decreased 33% to $1.6 billion. The drop in operating income was attributable to lower ad revenue and higher sports programming and production costs.

International channels’ revenue for the quarter dropped 18% to $1.1 billion and operating income fell 65% to $85 million.

The brightest spot for Disney in the quarter was its Parks, Experiences and Products group, which saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion, reflecting increased guest spending at international and domestic parks and experiences (primarily at Disney’s international parks and resorts).

Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenues, which includes box office revenue, increased 18% to $2.2 billion and saw an operating loss of of $50 million, down from an increase of $16 million year over year.

Per Disney, “the improvement at theatrical distribution was due to the continued success of ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’ which was released in the first quarter of the current year, partially offset by the comparison to co-production income in the prior-year quarter from Marvel’s ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home.’ The current quarter included the release of ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ whereas the prior-year quarter included the release of ‘Death on the Nile.'”

Disney stock closed Wednesday at $101.14 per share. The regular U.S. stock markets will reopen Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET."|0.96|1077|0|1077|[]

t3_13e0e52|1683746292.0|investing|Occidental Petroleum Redeems 6.5% of Preferred Stock Held by Berkshire Hathaway: the mechanics of this redemption|"Occidental Petroleum Corp. (Occidental: OXY) redeemed a small portion (6.47%) of its preferred Series A stock held by Berkshire Hathaway (BH) during the first quarter of 2023. Some of the details are hazy if you read the financial press like Yahoo Finance and Motley Fool. So I’ll explain the mechanics of the redemption that actually took place.  
  
Berkshire owned 100,000 shares of Occidental's 8% preferred stock with a face value of $100,000 each: that was as of year-end 2022. So the total value held by BH was 100k x $100k = $10 billion. Easy enough. Occidental has a mandatory redemption program with this preferred stock governed by provisions regarding dividends and stock repurchases. For example, if Occidental spends more than $4.00 per share in either (i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share has to be redeemed with a 10% premium. This is for the preceding twelve months, i.e., the last twelve month (LTM) period.  
  
So let's go through these numbers. Occidental paid out 57¢ in common dividends in the LTM period. Remember, Occidental recently increased its quarterly dividend by 38.5% from 13¢ to 18¢. That just happened in March 2023. So 13¢ x 3 + 18¢ = 57¢. How much LTM repurchases were there? Per 10-K, Occidental spent \~$3.0 billion on common stock repurchases during calendar year 2022; in Q1 2023, it spent \~$700 million; in Q1 2022, the amount was $36.6 million. These numbers are rounded so we can't arrive at the exact number -- but it's around $3.7 billion for the LTM ending March 31, 2023.  
  
Divide $3.7 billion by the weighted average common shares outstanding over the period. Again, the rounding makes things inexact: but that’s around $4.14 per share. Add to this the dividends per share of 57¢ = $4.71. Occidental has to mandatorily redeem anything above $4.00. So there is your 71¢. But how does 71¢ translate to the amount that has to be redeemed? Multiply by the weighted average shares outstanding, which I estimate to be around 908 million: $0.71 x 908 million = $645 million; this is close enough to the $646.8 million that Occidental is redeeming (the Preferred Stock Agreement between Occidental and BH has exact provisions on how these numbers are calculated for the redemption).  
  
BH also received a 10% premium above the redemption amount. So $647 million x 10% = $64.7 million. That’s the total cash outflow to BH for this redemption: $647 + $64.7 = $711.7 million. This is why on page 4 of Occidental’s 10-Q, you see $712 million as “Preferred stock redemption payable”: this is a current liability item due to BH to be settled by Occidental within 12 months.  
  
Remember, GAAP follows accrual, not cash, accounting. Page 21 of the 10-Q says, “Of the $712 million mandatory redemptions accrued as of March 31, 2023, $551 million of preferred stock redemptions, inclusive of a 10% premium, were settled in cash subsequent to March 31, 2023 but before the date of this filing.” Therefore, Occidental bought some time and paid $551 million of the $712 million between April 1st and May 9th of 2023.  
  
So how does $646.8 million in redemption translate to BH’s ownership of the preferred? Remember, there were 100,000 preferred shares with $100k in face value. The redeemed amount ($646.8 million) divided by $100k is 6,468 preferred shares. Therefore, the remaining shares owned by BH is 100k – 6,468 = 93,532, as shown on page 21 of the 10-Q.  
  
Let’s try to interpret the larger implication of this redemption. Barron’s, for example, claims that Occidental has begun to “rid itself of a high-cost source of financing” which Carl Icahn compared to “taking candy from a baby.” Well, that was back in 2019 prior to the start of COVID-19, when the average Fed Fund Rate (FFR) was around 2.16% for the year. Now the FFR is around 5%. Occidental’s credit rating is Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&amp;P and Fitch; it’s considered high yield by two of the three rating agencies. The long-term Baa yield is around 5.5%; the high yield rate for bond funds with majority BB components is as high as 7.5% to 8.5%. The proper yield for Occidental’s long-term debt would be something in between: it would probably be 6% to 7%. Plus Occidental gets tax deductibility from its debt, unlike the preferred dividends distributed with after-tax earnings.  
  
So yes, it does make sense to redeem a portion of the eligible preferred stock but it was mandatory anyway. BH still holds 93.5% of the preferred shares (93,532). If the dividends and share repurchases stay at the same rate, Occidental could redeem the entire preferred stock in 16 quarters or 4 years. But with the likely recession in the offing and lower oil prices affecting dividends and share repurchases, the redemption of the preferred could get drawn out and BH could end up holding the preferred for many more years."|0.8|30|0|30|['Occidental Petroleum Corp.']

*Original Source:*


https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-watchdog-says-it-found-unacceptable-problems-with-chinese-company-audits-2023-05-10/


WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. accounting watchdog found unacceptable deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by KPMG in China and PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong, the government agency said on Wednesday.


The U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)published the findings of its inspections after gaining access to Chinese company auditors' records for the first time last year following more than a decade of negotiations with Chinese authorities. That access kept roughly 200 China-based public companies from potentially being kicked off U.S. stock exchanges.


The deficiencies were so great that auditors failed to obtain enough evidence to substantiate companies' financial statements, PCAOB Chair Erica Williams told reporters on Wednesday. The firms, two of the so-called ""Big Four"" in accounting, represent 40% of the market share of U.S.-listed companies audited by Hong Kong and mainland China firms, she said.


PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in Hong Kong said it is working with the PCAOB to address issues raised and noted the inspection report marks an important milestone for U.S. and Chinese cooperation. KPMG's firm in China said in a statement it has taken steps to address the issues the PCAOB had found.


While the findings are consistent with what the agency usually discovers when gaining access to a foreign country's audit records for the first time, they will likely raise worries among global investors over the accuracy of U.S.-listed Chinese companies' public financial statements."|0.9|176|0|176|[]

t3_13dynqj|1683742400.0|investing|How will floating-rate treasury funds (USFR, TFLO) fare when interest rates start to fall?|"Since interest rates started rising, there have been endless discussions on where to park cash to maximize yield, preserve capital, maintain liquidity, etc.

People recommend high-yield savings, CDs, T-bill ladders, money market funds (like VUSXX, SPAXX, FZDXX), and short-term treasury ETFs (like SGOV).

Recently, floating-rate treasury funds like USFR and TFLO have been getting more attention. They respond quickly to interest rate changes so their yield is very attractive in a rising-rate environment, yet they are treasuries backed by the US government (default is another topic) and as ETFs they are very liquid. Their prices fluctuate minimally based on the monthly dividend schedule.

Obviously floating-rate funds are attractive when rates are rising. However, I know I'm not the only investor who would try to ride the floating rates to the top, and then immediately want to switch to something else when rates start to fall.

If rates start to fall, won't virtually everyone holding floating rate funds want to sell? Would it be difficult to find buyers for USFR/TFLO at that point, and would value of the shares fall significantly? Obviously the yield would decrease with interest rates, but I'm trying to figure out if there's much principal risk investing in these funds.

Floating rate treasury notes have only been around since 2013. In that time we've seen one period of falling interest rates (2019-2020). Looking at the historical prices of USFR and TFLO, there's maybe a slight dip (0.25% or less) around then, but nothing major.

t3_13dsx87|1683730173.0|investing|I am very confused by bid-ask spreads|"I've read the definitions. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the bid price, the highest price a buyer is willing to pay, and the ask price, the lowest price a seller is willing to sell. I understand that it gives a good idea of the liquidity of an asset. That the spread also theoretically measures the loss one would incur on an asset if they were to buy and sell a share instantaneously. This makes sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also makes that the ask price should always be greater than the bid price, given that we are profit-maximizing agents. What I don't understand is how there is a spread in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

When I place a market order (usually for a stock that I want to hold long-term so limit orders are of little value to me), would the order not automatically execute at the ask price? Since I am implicitly defining my bid price as what the market rate is, which is the ask price. Why would the spread not be zero? How does the market maker pocket a spread here, it feels like it comes out of thin air. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know there are cases where there are low volume ETFs with massive bid-ask spreads. The bid price may be say $90 while the ask price is $300. In this case, is everyone just placing limit orders and the highest limit order being placed is $90 while the last price the ETF was traded at is $300? If I were to see the ETF, be totally indifferent to its price, and place a market order, would this not just erase this massive bid-ask spread?

I have a decent amount (about 30) of EE bonds that my grandmother has given me over the years. I’m trying to figure out what makes the best sense for cashing them in. 

One of them was issued over 30 years ago so from what I understand, I absolutely need to cash that one in. 

16 of them were issued over 20 years ago so they’re above face value. The remainder were issued less than 20 years ago. 

I’m having a hard time figuring out what to do, especially given the current economic environment with high inflation. In addition, it seems like there’s different interest rates involved. For instance, on the bond that’s over 30 years old, it has a face value of $50 with a current value of $103.68. There’s an 09/1994 $50 with a current value of $77.84 and an 09/1995 $50 with a current value of $56.90. That doesn’t make much sense to me. Does this mean that my 09/1995 will be worth $77.84 in one more year, and $103.68 when it hits 30 years? Or does this mean that they set a different rate every month/year? 

Sorry if this seems like basic questions but I’m trying to make an educated decision here. I don’t want to walk away from a lot of interest (it’s not like I need the money right now) but I also don’t want to wait 5 years to cash in a $50 bond in order to make an extra $5, given todays high inflation.

I've also been told there is no way to automate this, so every month now I am going to have to transfer these matches into my target date fund, which is not the end of the world but pretty annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

 It should be noted depending on how your kids inherit money will determine if/how they will need to pay taxes on it.  Any money left to your children in a 401k (pre-tax), they will need to pay tax on this money, and are currently required to distribute it over a 10 year time period.  This will increase taxes they owe and is not an efficient way to leave inheritance.  Money in a non-qualified account receives a step-up in basis, and is a more efficient way to leave dollars to your kids.  Money left to your kids in a Roth IRA or life insurance is tax free to your children.   


The estate tax is a different ball of wax, and is not/was not considered when making my recommendations to you, as this was knowingly not a concern due to our discussions/analysis.

t3_13bwqzp|1683562665.0|investing|How can you trade interest rate futures as a retail investor?|"*Sorry in advance if this counts as a ""low effort"" post, I am looking to learn something which I haven't found any good resources on yet in this sub or other investing subs.*

I'm interested in the mechanics of how to put on a macro bet on interest rates. I know effectively nothing about futures contracts, and have never traded one. I consider myself a Buffett style value investor and I usually don't involve myself in any kind of macro analysis/forecasts.

I was looking at the CME Group's [Fed Watch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) and was struck by how tight the distribution is of implied probabilities and feel like tail events can occur that could result in a large payoff. For instance how do I trade the other side of the trade that 9/20/23 meeting has a 425-450bps or lower interest rate as a result (currently forecast at 0.0% probability) or get paid \~27:1 (reverse of 3.6% + 0.1% probability) betting that interest rates are 500bps or higher in November? **If I wanted to take the other side of the probabilities shown, how would I do this in a trade as a retail investor?**

I looked into put/call options on 3-month SOFR futures, these didn't appear to offer the same upside for these tail probabilities as implied but I also might not be understanding these instruments correctly. I am a retail investor using TD Ameritrade/ThinkorSwim so if the answer is call Goldman and get them to write a swap agreement then that is good to know but not actionable.

I have never placed a futures contract trade of any kind, so I appreciate anyone that can help point me in the right direction here. Don't worry, I assume that any of these trades are suicide and the money will evaporate so it will be an ultra-tiny position by any definition, I mostly just want to learn the mechanics. I'd love to be able to get involved in these trades the next time a January 2020 covid-like situation occurs."|0.89|67|0|67|[]

 I think you all now this retailer H&amp;M - It is one of the closest competitor to Inditex (Zara) It runs a similar clothing business model (though Inditex has the competitive advantange in their logistics and supply chain management) 

Anyways, we are not studying the quality of the business rather highlighting a valuation pattern that I've seen in a lot of indexes, stock exchange in the OECD countries

* I was wondering why this stock rallied when my perception was that the retailers like this weren't the high growth high-street shops that I used to know
* Going through the fundamentals, its 2022 sales compared to 2019 is still -5% (though YoY is a growth of 12%)
* Gross Margins decrease from the close to 60% to 51% 
*  Net Margins came down from the 10% to 2% But yet, the share price PE ratio is now back to 15 (10Yrs average is 18) 
* Dividend yield is 4.5% 
* Considering that US T Gov bills yields better and bear ""no risk"" ... this is a valuation that I don't understand 

 Why would you buy a company that is getting worst and worst in terms of margins and profitability ratios?

Well, the only thing that explains this is that probably by diversification rules institutions have to buy some stocks in Sweden, or the local pension funds have to invest a % of the cash in the Swedish stock market and there are no much asset class or stocks where you can put your cash in

Too many cash, chasing too few assets

The U.S. dollar can hardly escape its current role as a unit of measurement for commodities. Instead, it is hoped that those countries that are passive participants in global economic affairs will demand a seat at the table. It is expected that in the coming years we will need to get used to a truly multi-currency financial system.

That gold denominated in U.S. dollars represents only a small fraction of the overall gold trade. This means that the price of gold measured in dollars is wrong.

The more we look at how gold performs in other currencies, the more we understand how it performs as a growth asset and a means of preserving value.

Gold at around $2,000 cannot be considered expensive and a pullback to $1,900 or $1,800 is not important to investors. Gold will be seen as an investment for at least five to 10 years. In that time, he believes gold will not disappoint.

It is not impossible to buy physical gold and silver now; market participants may not be able to find the product they want or may face a longer wait. They may also encounter minimum spending levels when making purchases.

In the long run, buying physical precious metals does become more difficult.

""Some time in the future, bullion will largely disappear and the only option you will have left in terms of getting some type of distribution ......

I'm looking to hear some constructive criticism of my approach, what I should change/apply, or if there are some tools that can help me to do that in a less manual form.

Both tabs in the sheet take the same parameters (marked in red):

* Initial Capital (current liquid NW)
* Approximations for various rates, like SPY, REIT
* Rent parameters
* REIT / Homeownership parameters
* 2nd tab: excess income

I did not think too deeply about the correctness of the estimated parameters but I modeled them off of my current understanding of the market and the cost of living. I intentionally did not include any other expenses besides REIT to keep it simple / less prone to misestimations.

First Tab simulates a scenario where the entire income is spent on living expenses but it does not cover rent. Rent is being paid out of savings. All other income is spent, hence no income to invest. This is rather a silly estimation but I like it because it can show me the drastic impact of mortgage rates on NW in 30 years and that I will run out of money faster if I buy vs rent.

The second tab is a more realistic scenario that includes income that provides excess money inflow after all non-housing-related expenses.

I want to make sure I did not miss anything important and not over/underestimated certain paraments before jumping to conclusions. Eventually, I want to make a data-driven decision towards Buy vs. Rent.

A comparison of four communication styles.|"Investing is not only about numbers and analysis, but also about communication and persuasion. How you present your investment strategy to others can have a big impact on your success and reputation. In this post, I will compare and contrast four communication styles of different types of investors: growth, trend follower, passive and value. Which one do you identify with the most?  

\- Growth Investor: This investor has the most persuasive and visionary communication style. They use metaphors like ""hidden gems"" and ""ride the wave of change"" to appeal to the emotions and imagination of others. They also use stories and examples of successful companies like Amazon and Tesla to back up their claims. They handle objections by pointing out the flaws and limitations of other strategies, and by emphasizing the future prospects and potential of their investments. They demonstrate emotional intelligence by showing enthusiasm, confidence and optimism. They align their strategy with their values of innovation, disruption and exponential growth.  

\- Trend Follower: This investor has a clear and adaptable communication style. They use metaphors like ""capture the big moves"" and ""adapt to the market reality"" to convey their flexibility and responsiveness. They also use empirical evidence and historical data to support their claims. They handle objections by challenging the assumptions and myths of other strategies, and by highlighting the inefficiencies and anomalies of the market. They demonstrate emotional intelligence by showing resilience, discipline and pragmatism. They align their strategy with their goals of capital appreciation and risk management.  

\- Passive Investor: This investor has a simple and smart communication style. They use metaphors like ""guarantee market returns"" and ""minimal hassle and stress"" to convey their ease and efficiency. They also use academic theories and research to support their claims. They handle objections by questioning the ability and performance of other strategies, and by pointing out the costs and taxes of active investing. They demonstrate emotional intelligence by showing patience, humility and rationality. They align their strategy with their values of simplicity, consistency and compounding.  

\- Value Investor: This investor has a weak and defensive communication style. They use metaphors like ""buy low sell high"" and ""margin of safety"" to convey their caution and prudence. They also use financial statements and ratios to support their claims. They handle objections by defending their strategy as timeless and proven, and by dismissing other strategies as fads or bubbles. They demonstrate emotional intelligence by showing perseverance, diligence and integrity. They align their strategy with their values of value, quality and contrarianism. I think value investing is a valid and respectable strategy, but it also has some challenges and drawbacks in terms of communication. For example, value investors may have difficulty convincing others of their investment thesis, especially when the market is irrational or euphoric. They may also face criticism or ridicule from other investors who follow different strategies or trends. They may also struggle to communicate their value proposition and competitive edge in a crowded and competitive market. These are some of the reasons why I think value investors have a weak and defensive communication style. Of course, this does not mean that they are bad investors or that they cannot improve their communication skills. It just means that they have some room for improvement and some opportunities to learn from other communication styles after devastating growth periods and no mean reversion periods.


Let me know which communication style do you prefer or practice?"|0.35|0|0|0|[]

* 35.81% domestic equity
* 29.85% international equity
* 16.66% domestic fixed income
* 13.40% international fixed income
* 3.10% cash &amp; equivalents
* 1.18% other

I'm curious to know what you all think about this type of comprehensive plan as a long-term investment strategy. For context, I'm 34 years old, married, and have three children aged 1 month, 4, and 6. I'm the breadwinner of the family and this investment is my only one outside of my 401k at work, which maxes out at 6% in terms of what my employer will match.

In addition to my investment portfolio, I currently have a $250,000 whole life insurance policy and am looking to buy a 20-year $2 million term insurance policy.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts and suggestions on how I can improve my portfolio and investment strategy. Thanks in advance for your insights!"|0.76|16|0|16|[]

Would it make sense for me to sell an investment that is positive and realize those capital gains; Then turn around and use that cash to rebuy the same stock (assume using 100% of the proceeds, so selling 10 shares and buying exactly 10 shares back)?

I'm thinking that yes-- this makes sense. Because it means that not only do I realize more of the capital loss now for tax advantage. But it means that when I do eventually sell the shares that I realized the gain on-- Ive technically already realized and paid those taxes upfront. So I do not need to pay taxes on them in the future on said gains (obviously the new gains at that future point notwithstanding).

t3_139yfid|1683398660.0|investing|Low-end primary residence vs index stock portfolio annual yield?|"This is quite anecdotal, and only applies to specific situations such as the example below, but I'm going to ask anyway.

Let's consider a low-end primary residence at which you yourself will reside. Let's say a $150,000 house (obviously where such a liveable house can be bought, say Iowa), and let's assume you have 150k cash to buy it directly with no loan.

It is generally accepted that over time real-estate value grows by around 5% annually (let's ignore recent years where the value grew disproportionately, around 12% YoY).

Now, the way I see it, you would be saving at least $800 of rent per month on such a property which is 9,600 a year - **theoretically after tax**, so let's assume this amount is actually worth around $12,000 (assuming 20% tax was imposed on the general earnings, say from selling stocks, before they were used to theoretically pay rent).

A house as such (150k) should cost around $3,000 in property taxes and basic annual maintenance, I suppose, so I will deduct that amount.

To summarize the *theoretical* gains, the property should yield around ((5,000 + 12,000) - 3,000) = $14,000 annually before tax.

Now the [historical] general expected earnings from the stock market should be around 8% (again, here too, I am discounting the past few years), so around $12,000 before tax for a 150k index portfolio.

Now I know these numbers are nowhere near perfect, and this is quite a specific situation, but generally, it seems to me that if you have the cash and the will to live in a lower-end property which is purchased without a loan, it's worth more than holding index funds in the stock market and renting said property.

t3_139wt3y|1683395120.0|investing|Would the demystification and increase in public trust in the stock market cause a decrease in returns and perception of its risk (short term or long term)?|"There are a couple of factors I'm thinking of: 

- as the market's history and positive track record increases 
- as education and access to information increases, especially via the Internet
- the accessibility of investing, with the increase of accessible tools with user friendly interfaces 

Those factors seem to lead to increasing trust in the stock market's returns. Does this lead people to view the risk in the stock market to be much less? Would this impact returns in any way? Short term or long term. 

The last two factors can be counter productive. There's a lot or misinformation, and some investing tools make it too easy to fuck up. But that doesn't change the other effect of more people investing wisely and trusting the market better.

The way I understand it, which may be wrong, is that the risk / uncertainty involved is a big contribution to a stock's price. As time goes on, some of that uncertainty becomes certain. A company does indeed make positive earnings, etc., and the uncertainty about this event disappears, increasing the value of the stock.

If people view returns on the stock market to be more certain than they used to 50 years ago, then the discount due to risk is reduced, right? People are willing to pay more for a similar amount of risk, just because their own perception of it is that it is less risky.

But recently I read about potential problems everywhere, like high inflation, real estate collapse, yearly debt default debate, etc. And the most dangerous thing is that the Petrodollar might be in danger, and more countries might want to join China and friends org (BRICS). Also I see news about social problems everywhere (mass Walmart looting, increasingly frequent shooting, rising sea level = goodbye Florida, California water shortage =  mass unrest in 20 years, etc).

**Is it normal to assume the US will always win and we'll fix all those problems later?** Currently I don't see anywhere more stable than US markets; Europe has dying population problem + too strict laws = little innovation (which end-user tech products have you been using that come from Europe?), so I'd rather select manually a few stocks there instead of buying broad-market ETFs. Other international markets are kinda sketchy (rip $BABA), and subject to geopolitical changes.

But I can't say the US economy is currently safe. **Its debt is insane and will only keep increasing**. If the government keep (practically) printing money, it's possible it won't be the global currency anymore because ""why does the US get to control the entire world's money""? The USD has been the global reserve currency for many generations, so I can't imagine what effects it might have.

Really this is just a spinoff of the classic predicting future cash flows and discounting it, only it also takes into account shareholder's equity. To me, it doesn't make sense because it seems the intrinsic value is making the investor pay twice, once for shareholder's equity and another for the FCF multiple. I do like that it takes into account the growth of shareholder's equity, but not that it takes into the value of the whole equity. To refute this, ChatGPT shows me that I am in fact the irrational one as the intrinsic value is near real market cap for stocks that are said to be near fair value.

I am restarting my investing strategy in my Roth from the ground up. I’ve been doing a lot of reading, researching, and back testing (I understand past performance is not a guarantee of future). I want to reach out for others advice, opinions or anything you would change about my current thoughts on how to set up my portfolio. We are talking on a 30 to 40 year timeline here. I had two ideas I can’t decide on.

Idea #1:

VTI - 70%
VEA - 10%
VWO - 10%
VIOV or VBR - 10%

I’m not sure if this is even a decent allocation/weighting but it felt right to me. I couldn’t decide between VIOV or VBR. I know they track different indexes and VBR has a lower fee. This portfolio would be a cheaper alternative fee wise.

Idea #2:

VTI - 60%
VEA - 10%
AVEM - 10%
AVUV - 10%
AVDV* - 10%

I definitely think I could live without AVDV and just add 5% to VTI and the other 5% to AVUV. This portfolio definitely carry’s higher expense ratios but I have somewhat bought into the Avantis investing strategy and active management. I also sought AVEM over AVES but would appreciate any advise on why you wouldn’t pick that. I am a bit more aggressive here but I do believe in Avantis funds long term. I am also unsure on whether emerging markets is necessary. 

As you can see I am trying to tilt certain areas, specifically SCV. I also value at least a 20% up to 30% international position as this is a buy and hold portfolio and anything could happen in the next few decades. I tried not to weight anything lower than 10% or do 5% weighted funds as that seemed pointless to me from what I have read.

Please let me know what you think. Would you change the weighting? The tilts? Add or subtract any funds? Which idea would you go with, #1 or #2? I am so torn on these options. I will probably post this in a few subs to gather advice. Thank you all in advance."|0.78|11|0|11|[]

t3_1384l5f|1683245002.0|investing|Investing in Terminally Old Industries|"Investing in new and growing industries makes obvious sense to people. You buy the business now, it grows, and now you have an identical percentage ownership of a larger company. However, the average returns of investing in new industries is a lot less than you think as new investors are an issue. That is, companies grow quickly by taking on debt and/or equity funding which is not only risky but decreases earnings per share.

The drag debt causes on returns is obvious, as money is spent on interest payments that could be returned to investors in some fashion. People like equity investments because it tends to hide that risk by shifting it onto a new investor, but it has the same effect on stock performance. If you receive equity funding, your percentage ownership instantly shrinks and there is no guarantee that the business will grow to compensate.

Look at the opposite end of things, with industries expected to terminate in the foreseeable future. Remember; Someone was breeding horses when the car was invented, and had to find a new way to make money. You might think these guys will just go out of business one by one and be forced to sell all their possessions, but often the best performing stocks on the market are the end-of-life stocks.

1. They have ""low cost of capital."" They're using the same assets (buildings, equipment, funds) they always have meaning they don't need to get expensive debt or equity funding to keep making money.
2. They have been profitable for a long time and often have savings in the form of stocks and bonds.
3. They can pay generous share buybacks or dividends.

Remember: All we care about is earnings-per-share, and with terminally old industries you will see a diminishing number of investors as companies buy back their own shares. Yes, the share price can keep going up even as a company sells off its buildings.

There was a statistical study done of where all the shares in the market were since all shares are owned by someone. It found that risky pre-profit companies were preferentially held by active fund managers of all sorts, while obscure and old companies were preferentially held by quant and arbitrage funds using math to turn a profit. The funny thing is, the quants are the ones holding shares perceived as trash, but the star fund managers are the ones holding shares that are actually trash.

This isn't intended to give any sort of fund recommendation, I say this to show how in a fully efficient market it simply does not matter what is old or new or what is obsolete and what is high-tech, because all risk and rewards are priced into the market."|0.53|1|0|1|[]

I don't want to talk politics here beyond the objective facts. Republicans want spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, and Democrats want the debt ceiling raised without any conditions. Representatives from both sides stringently say they're unwilling to compromise at all. They're even explicitly unwilling to pass a short-term debt ceiling raise to allow more time for discussions. I know this is (unfortunately) not exactly out of the ordinary.

However, what's starting to worry me about today's situation is that both sides are instead looking at ways they can circumvent the other, seeming to be the latest strategy in today's historically divided politics. House Democrats took the next step in starting a discharge petition for a debt-ceiling increase, a move that could allow them to go around Republican leaders. The White House is looking at ""experimental ways"" to keep the government paying its bills without a debt ceiling increase, like suspending payments to Social Security, military contractors, etc, issuing short-term high-interest rate bonds, or issuing debt ""under the 14th amendment."" I just don't think there's enough time in one month to do this dance and I'm afraid of the horrendous outcome a default could make, in addition to all the other economic headwinds we're facing.

&gt;China is putting the yuan front and center in its fight back against the US's unique influence over global money.

&gt;President Xi Jinping's government has been busy striking deals over the past year to expand the ways in which the currency is used, with new agreements linked to the renminbi stretching from Russia and Saudi Arabia to Brazil and even France. 

&gt;While the US remains the world’s clear financial hegemon, these moves are helping China to carve out a bigger place for itself in the international financial system. They come at a time when geopolitical strains are growing and global commerce is becoming an ever-more-active battleground.

&gt;Antagonism has flared between the two economic titans over issues ranging from trade and Taiwan to TikTok and technological know-how. Hard-hitting sanctions on Russia have revealed a new willingness by the US to weaponize the dollar. Together, that's done more to promote China's yuan over the past year than Xi’s government achieved in the preceding decade. 

&gt;The ramp-up is also a response to China’s shifting position within the global economy as it emerges from the era of Covid-lockdowns with growth running more slowly than it once did and the global push for freer trade in retreat. That's spurred leaders in Beijing to up the ante in building the country — and in particular its currency — into an alternative pole for international finance, trade and lending.

&gt;The nation is working to demonstrate “that there’s a world outside of the US and the Western world,” said Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation and co-head of global investment management for the Asia-Pacific region at UBS Global Wealth Management’s office in Hong Kong. ""You're sending a very strong signal to the US by basically saying we don't need you and we don't need your US dollar.""

&gt;That message is resonating in some parts of the world. Unease with the dominance of the US and the greenback is pushing some countries and companies to diversify away from America and Europe.

&gt;The use of the renminbi in contracts for everything from oil to nickel is gathering speed, with the currency’s share of global trade finance tripling since the end of 2019. That's still a tiny portion of global transactions, and the currency remains tightly controlled by Chinese authorities. But sanctions that ensnared Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine have added to that pace. The yuan’s usage in Russian export payments surged 32-fold last year alone.

&gt;Going Global

&gt;Xi, who is embarking on his second decade in charge of the People’s Republic, has taken steps to promote the country’s  reputation abroad, even as he focuses on implementing reforms and bolstering growth at home. His first foreign excursions after lifting lockdowns were to key energy suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia.

&gt;Trips to Beijing by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and France’s Emmanuel Macron were accompanied by a host of new commercial agreements. And China was central to brokering an Iran-Saudi detente.

&gt;With the US, though, flashpoints have multiplied — from feuds over spy balloons to semiconductor technology.

&gt;The ostracism of Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has provided China with an important opening to demonstrate just how the yuan can be used. It also stoked concern among some nations about being beholden to the dollar and the euro, the two biggest currencies.

&gt;Locked out of the central international payments system known as SWIFT, Russia embraced the yuan for trade, private savings and foreign-exchange transactions. China has developed its own international-payments platform — CIPS — that’s entirely separate from SWIFT, which has been embraced not only by institutions in Russia, but also by banks that operate in places like Brazil.

&gt;“China's willingness to maintain growth while paving new paths lends itself for other nations to have greater confidence to use the yuan,’’ said Victor Gao, a professor at Soochow University and vice president of think tank Center for China and Globalization. “If the US wants to rock the boat, then China will need to make necessary amendments to meet the challenges.’’

&gt;Neither the People’s Bank of China nor the country’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange immediately responded to faxes seeking comment.

&gt;Russian Experiment

&gt;The seeds of Russia’s move toward the yuan were planted back in 2014, when the annexation of Crimea prompted the US and its allies to threaten Moscow’s access to the mainstream financial system. But it was the full-blown invasion of Ukraine last year that fast-tracked China’s acceptance.

&gt;Yuan savings accounted for 11% of Russia’s total deposits as of January, compared with practically none before the war, and the yuan has replaced the dollar and euro as the most traded currency from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.

&gt;Russia and others have also begun to use the yuan in transactions that don’t even involve China. Bangladesh, for example, agreed with Russia last month to settle a $300 million payment related to the building of a nuclear plant near Dhaka in renminbi, according to officials familiar with the matter.

&gt;The Chinese currency has made major inroads into all walks of Russian financial life since the war in Ukraine broke out

&gt;As oil income helps Russia’s public finances to stabilize, the nation may even be looking to buy yuan in an effort to rebuild foreign reserves.

&gt;But there are limits to the experiment. The Kremlin has been left with very few choices, and China’s financial offerings still struggle to compete. Without deep capital markets or open capital accounts, it can be difficult to move money in and out of the country — a complaint longtime investor Mark Mobius voiced earlier this year. 
Yuan’s Hurdles

&gt;The lack of deep, free markets is a hindrance if China really wanted to take on the dollar or euro as the global currency of choice. 

&gt;A fully international yuan “can’t happen unless China allows greater freedom of the currency and inward as well as outward investment,” said Jim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist who coined the term BRICs more than two decades ago to describe what were then the four big emerging-market powerhouses with potential to challenge the existing economic order.

&gt;Even with the drumbeat of international deals, the currency is not fully convertible. There are restrictions on its use in areas such as cross-border loans and portfolio investments.

&gt;Limitations on the variety of renminbi-based investment products — and the simple inertia that stems from sticking with the prevailing reserve currency — are also major impediments to the yuan becoming broadly accepted as an alternative to the dollar.

&gt;“There’s still a long way to go for China to build up its global clout,” said Chen Xingdong, head of global markets research in China at BNP Paribas SA.

&gt;In the first few decades of this century, China has taken steps to open up stock and bond markets to encourage inbound investment and loosened some of the strictures around its managed currency. But Xi's government has resisted broader measures that would encourage international yuan usage — such as allowing capital to flow freely — to avoid the possibility of sudden outflows that stand to potentially destabilize the economy and threaten the Communist Party's grip on power.

&gt;“There's so much money queuing up from China to go outside, and there's probably a limit on how much outside money is queuing to go back in,” said UBS’s Zuercher. “Controlling capital flows is still extremely important.""
One story you'll want to talk about.

&gt;The renminbi is only the fifth-most popular currency for cross-border payments. Excluding payments between countries that share the euro, China’s currency accounted for 1.7% of cross-border payments at the end of March, compared to around 50% for the dollar and 22% for Europe’s common currency, according to data from SWIFT. That, of course, doesn’t include transactions made via China’s CIPS alternative, but that system as a whole is still dwarfed by the mainstream SWIFT platform. 

&gt;Diversification Demand

&gt;Still, for those in China itself, the usage of the yuan in international transactions has just recently surpassed the dollar, according to research from Bloomberg Intelligence and based on State Administration of Foreign Exchange data.

&gt;The local currency’s share of cross-border payments and receipts hit a record high of 48% at the end of March, compared with almost zero back in 2010, while the dollar’s share dropped to 47%.

&gt;Even with the the dollar’s dominance relatively entrenched for years to come, some observers speculate that the greenback is headed for a longer-term decline. The events giving life to yuan usage right now may ultimately be a key contributor.

&gt;Repercussions from Russia’s war have made other nations anxious about the risk of US-led sanctions, said Esther Law, a senior money manager at Amundi SA. She expects the yuan to continue rising in popularity amid the fear of US-led sanctions and as a “practical” part of China’s growing role as a lender.

&gt;The perk of diversification also applies to China. There’s safety in having standing arrangements with a plethora of trading partners in case simmering tensions with the US turn to a boil. 

&gt;“Geopolitical tensions just make it that much more important for China to promote the international use of its own currency,” said Stephen Jen, co-founder of Eurizon SLJ Capital. “There is a war of attrition now between the US and China, in investment and finance.”"|0.3|0|0|0|[]

According to Hindenburg, the answer for the exorbitant premium commanded by IEP has to do with 2 reasons:  (1) the Icahn name and mystique built on years of activist investing and corporate raiding career; and (2) the inordinately high dividend yield -- 15.5% prior to the fall and now even higher at 25%.  The eye-popping dividend yield is hooking gullible retail investors in.  There is the familiar culprit in Jefferies, which is Icahn's chosen investment banker for continuous offerings, bka at the money (ATM) offerings.  However, whenever you wanna confuse and addle retail investors, there are these paper mills that spew misinformation:  we're talking about low-quality investing sites tailored to the retail money like Motley Fool, InvestorPlace, YahooFinance and another site which I had never heard of before, Income Investors.

Remember, ""dividend investing"" has been the mantra for retiring baby-boomers that want to live off of qualified dividends.  They typically gravitate to income mutual funds or dividend aristocrat ETFs like SCHD, VYM, VIG and COWZ.  None of these mainstream ETFs are in IEP but it's not surprising to find smaller and obscure names like Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF and Global X Guru Index ETF as holders of IEP.

In July 2022, that was only 10 months ago, the king of retail bullsheet site Motley Fool was gushing that IEP was topping the total return of Buffett's Berkshire shares: ""IEP is a rock solid dividend play with an all star manager at the helm, making it a must own stock in this turbulent market.""  Motley Fool followed that up with another puff piece in October 2022, which gushed that IEP has “ultra-high dividend yields, fundamentally strong businesses, and a proven ability to generate healthy levels of free cash flows in an uncertain economic environment.”   How would Motley Fool know IEP has fundamentally strong businesses?

Another retail site InvestorPlace, was promoting IEP among 3 stocks to buy “with your social security increase” because of its 14.8% dividend at the time.  Another retail site devoted to income investing, Income Investors, put out this red-lipstick-on-pig-lips marketing pitch:  ""If you are an income hog who wants to see your underlying investment rise, IEP might be a smart option right now""!  Who is not an income hog?

Do these sites even know how difficult it is to value closed-end funds like IEP that disclose limited details on valuation metrics used?  But per Hindenburg, the guiltiest party is still Jefferies, which is blatantly trying to hook retails investors in with its ponzi scam of continuous ATM offerings.  Here is how the ponzi scam works:  Jefferies has helped to sell $1.7 billion in IEP units to support dividend payments.  This is possible because Icahn, who owns 85% of IEP, is taking dividends in units, not cash.  In other words, the existing investors of IEP, i.e., the 15%, are being paid with the retail cash inflow from the offerings while the new ones will wait their turn.  It's the greater fool theory applied to a dividend aristocrat as IEP does not have the FCF to pay dividends; Jefferies, through its ATM offerings, is enabling the payout to the next fool who will, at some point, end up holding the bag.

So why does Hindenburg think Icahn and Jefferies are specifically targeting retail investors?  Aren't all investors, including institutional, pension funds, hedge funds, ETFs all into income investing?  There isn't a single noteworthy institutional investor in IEP, except passive ETFs and retail-oriented investors like Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd.  Plus not one serious research house is covering IEP except Jefferies.

And for many retail investors, the Icahn name still carries mystique: a titan of Wall Street who drives a hard bargain with management to walk away with windfalls and premiums.  However, it seems Icahn really isn't very good at running businesses or picking stocks like Buffett or Munger.  He's really only good at acting irascible, agitating for shareholder value and browbeating management, not creating or even managing value.  "|0.67|3|0|3|[]

FTA:

&gt; PacWest Bancorp., a regional bank teetering following the collapse of three rival California-based lenders, has been weighing a range of strategic options, including a sale, according to people familiar with the matter. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Beverly Hills-based bank has been working with a financial adviser and has also been considering a breakup or a capital raise, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. While it is open to a sale, the company hasn’t started a formal auction process, the people said.


MarketWatch cites this Bloomberg report as the cause of the afterhours drop:

&gt; PacWest Bancorp PACW shares dove more than 50% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after a report that the company’s executives are looking at a possible sale. The regional bank’s shares have been diving this week after the collapse and sale of another regional bank in the western U.S., First Republic Bank, which was sold to JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM Monday in a deal that netted shareholders nothing. Bloomberg News reported Wednesday afternoon that PacWest’s leaders were considering strategic alternatives of their own, which could include a sale, based on anonymous sources.

* [The Fed's Latest Interest Rate Hike Could Set Off a 'Domino Effect' in Regional Bank Failures](https://time.com/6276744/fed-interest-rate-hike-bank-failures/) Time Magazine. May 3, 2023.

FTA:

&gt; Analysts say that the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates again has renewed concerns that some midsize or regional banks that have suffered large withdrawals of deposits could be on the edge of a precipice. “Each incremental interest rate hike beyond what they had anticipated is going to exacerbate the banking problem significantly,” says Brian Bethune, a financial economist and economics professor at Boston College. “Once that trust starts to erode, then you have a domino effect. And we’re on the brink right now of a major domino effect in the regional banks.”

I'm just looking at PACW and WAL right now, as they're good enough indicators for me, but if anyone feels like putting in an entire list of regional bank stocks to watch, that would be great.

&gt;The US Treasury’s unexpectedly quick rollout of a program to buy back some outstanding debt securities suggests officials hope it will improve trading in the world’s biggest bond market.

&gt;The Treasury on Wednesday said that it will begin “regular and predictable” purchases of Treasuries sometime in the 2024 calendar year in the first buyback program since 2000.

&gt;Most dealers hadn’t expected an announcement so soon, amid continuing discussions between officials and market participants over how a program would be structured.

&gt;Unlike the last time, the new plan isn’t a side-effect of budget surpluses. The Treasury launched the previous initiative as a way of retiring some outstanding, higher-interest securities as it enjoyed an historic period of tax revenues outpacing spending.

&gt;Today, the federal government is running large deficits. But other challenges have cropped up in the $24 trillion Treasuries market. One is that regulations put in place after the global financial crisis requiring banks to set aside capital against Treasuries trading have left them less willing to engage in market-making.
Vulnerable Market

&gt;Analysts say that’s left the market vulnerable to bouts of illiquidity, especially for Treasuries that are no longer the current benchmarks — so-called off-the-runs. 

&gt;One of the two main aspects of the new buyback program will be to support liquidity, by purchasing older outstanding securities and selling more of current benchmarks.

&gt;The second main purpose, the Treasury said in Wednesday’s statement, will be to help with “cash management.” The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, or TBAC — a panel of investors, dealers and other market participants that regularly counsels the Treasury — has highlighted that the department’s sales of Treasury bills can be volatile as revenues and outlays fluctuate.

&gt;When the Treasury receives a big influx of revenue, as with tax receipts when annual filings are due in April, its cash balance surges and it cuts back its bill issuance. A buyback program would offer the Treasury the option of smoothing out bill issuance, while using large inflows of cash for buybacks.

&gt;“Operations will likely split into two categories: liquidity support for longer maturities (greater than one year), and cash management for maturities up to two years” Deutsche Bank AG Steven Zeng wrote in a note to clients.

&gt;The Treasury said that buybacks will “initially sized conservatively, and not intended to meaningfully change the overall maturity profile of marketable debt outstanding.” It added it will conduct more consultations. 

&gt;Stephen Stanley, chief US economist at Santander US Capital Markets LLC, noted that TBAC had indicated that the Treasury discussed “proposed sizing of ‘up to $240 billion per year,’ but it sounds like it would begin smaller and ramp up to that.”

&gt;Stanley said that Santander’s trading desk has highlighted one challenge: During its pandemic-driven quantiative easing program. the Federal Reserve amassed such a large stockpile of Treasuries that there may be limited volumes available of short-dated interest bearing securities for the Treasury to buy back.

&gt;Zeng at Deutsche Bank still suggested the program might help. It could achieve an outcome of “enhancing Treasury market liquidity especially for off-the-runs,” he wrote."|0.96|84|0|84|[]

It was also involved in managing continuous offerings, i.e., at the money offerings (ATM), of IEP worth about $1.7 billion. Icahn and JEF have a long history and Icahn bailed out Jefferies (JEF) when it got into illiquid sovereign debt issues which were falling fast in value (read Hindenburg's tweets). So the two have been scratching each other's back for a while.

Another sell-side firm that used to cover IEP was UBS, which dropped coverage in January 2020 citing ""lack of transparency, limited float ..."" among some of the reasons: of course one inevitable result of the lack of transparency was the significant premium above the net asset value at which IEP was trading. That premium was only about 60% according to UBS in early 2020.

Hindenburg calculates the fair value of IEP's current NAV at $4.4 billion. IEP's market cap is $14.3 billion right now, after falling from $18.6 billion prior to Hindenburg's report. Based on market cap, IEP is trading 325% above Hindenburg's estimated NAV.

IEP has also been paying out $2 per share in dividend which, annualized, is $2 x 4 = $8; $8 divided by current stock price of $40.36 = 20%. This was apparently a big lure for the retail money: IEP was paying out divvies like certain Brazilian conglomerates. However, if IEP was properly marked to market at $4.4 billion, which is equivalent to a stock price of only $12.44, then the dividend yield jacks up to $8 / $12.44 = 64.3%. Clearly unsustainable but enabled for the moment by JEF's management of IEP's ATM offerings (hence the accusation, ""malpractice""). The inordinate dividend will have to be cut as the market continues to tank and Icahn's market bets have soured -- he was shorting in 2022, which should have made him money. But he was apparently shorting the wrong stocks, and was on track to lose more than $250mm, ouch.

Forbes estimates Icahn has 85% of his wealth tied up in IEP, so he can't really deploy further capital into IEP, Hindenburg reckons. Also, IEP is hobbled by too much leverage -- net debt of $5.2 billion. When IEP's market equity drops to $4.4 billion, that translates to 54% debt in the capital structure -- this will surely kickstart covenant breaches in some debt indentures. Things won't end well for Icahn, thinks Hindenburg. Bill Ackman is piling in, rubbing it in, and observing, ""There is a karmic quality to this short report that reinforces the notion of a circle of life and death. As such, it is a must read.""  There is no love lost when talking about death.

Incidentally JEF is a Buffett stock but he has a very small stake (for BH) in the brokerage company: only $15 million. This does not mean the rest of the Wall Street gang is honest: they just don't cover something that smells egregiously bad. But there is enormous latitude in coverage and in giving out buy and overweight ratings to overvalued stocks: ""Put some lipstick on this pig."" Vermillion.

I already own a fair amount of physical real estate (rental apartments and houses) and I was trying to decide if I should buy more physical real estate, REITs or the wider US stock market (S&amp;P 500).  As part of this exercise I decided to look at the performance of Vanguard's REIT index fund (VGSLX) versus the SPX.  I started on 11/12/01 because that was the first trading day for VGSLX.

Interestingly - and somewhat counterintuitively - VGSLX outperformed SPX over the period by 111 percentage points cumulatively, including reinvested dividends (530% for VGSLX vs 419% for SPX).  VGSLX's annualized standard deviation averaged \~15% over the period vs SPX's standard deviation of \~21%.  So, over this particular 21.5 year period, REITs delivered higher returns and lower volatility than the S&amp;P.  These are pre-tax numbers, of course.  The beginning yield on VGSLX was 5.6% vs the SPX's yield of 1.7%.  That 3.9% beginning dividend yield differential engendered all of the outperformance.  As a result of the higher tax rate on dividends, taxable accounts would've have seen a much narrower spread in performance between VGSLX and SPX.  In non-taxable accounts all of the performance spread would have been captured.  

There's no recommendation here and, of course, ""past performance is not a guarantee of future results.""  But it is a bit unusual to see a single asset class outperform the wider market (1) over a long period of time, AND (2) with meaningfully lower volatility.   

When one can combine a dozen REITs today - and, importantly, avoiding some really risky exposures like office and class B malls, etc - and get to a yield of 7%+ and then pick up a couple of extra points of return through writing covered calls, I do wonder why I should even bother with physical RE (headaches) or the wider stock market (pricey and volatile).  Anyhow, I'm just thinking out loud."|0.73|15|0|15|[]

Can anyone explain how today is different from yesterday, or even the past few weeks, that the large investment firms decided it's time to sell off regional bank stocks? What exactly triggered this that it happened today?

Here are some articles from yesterday, May 1, that were Yahoo Finance headline articles, invoking the authority of the great Jamie Dimon who told us all was well with regional banks:

&gt; 
&gt; **""This part of the crisis is over,""** he told analysts on a Monday conference call.
&gt; 
&gt; In the last eight weeks, three of the biggest 30 US banks failed and hundreds of billions in deposits left small banks as customers scrambled for safety and higher yields.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; It puts Dimon back at the center of a banking crisis for the second time in 15 years. In 2008 JPMorgan purchased investment bank Bear Stearns and then Seattle’s Washington Mutual.
&gt; 
&gt; This period, he told reporters Monday, ""is **nothing like 2008, 2009** for a lot of different reasons.""

&gt; Regulators seized First Republic (FRC) early on Monday and sold most of the bank's operations to JPMorgan in the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the seizure of First Republic puts to rest panic for the banking system.
&gt; 
&gt; **""This part of the crisis is over,""** he told analysts on a Monday conference call.
&gt; 
&gt; A number of banks, including JPMorgan and PNC, had submitted bids on Sunday to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to acquire the embattled bank.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Shares JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) rose 3%** Monday morning.
&gt; 
&gt; In other news, interest rates will be in the spotlight this week as the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meeting kicks off on May 2. Markets put chances of a quarter-point hike at 86% as of Monday morning.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, data releases on construction spending, factory orders, jobless claims are on deck this week, and the big headliner at the end of the week will be the April jobs report. All the economic data is expected to lead to another volatile week for the Treasury yields.

The second article here goes into factors that should determine investment decisions this week, but didn't mention how investors will view the regional banks. Though at the beginning it did acknowledge that investors were ""digesting"" the move by J.P. Morgan to acquire First Republic.

&gt;PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp each slumped more than 25% Tuesday, leading a renewed selloff in regional lenders as investors continued to gauge the health of the industry after the second-largest US bank failure ever.

&gt;Trading in shares of both banks were halted for volatility, amid the broader slide that took the KBW Regional Banking Index down as much as 6.1%, the most intraday since March 17. Comerica Inc. and Zions Bancorp. each fell more than 10%, while Charles Schwab Corp., the brokerage with a bank arm that’s come under pressure in the wake of the regional banking tumult, sank 5.3%. 

&gt;The sector’s retreat comes a day after First Republic Bank’s seizure and sale to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and underscores investors’ ongoing concerns about competitors of the four banks that have collapsed since early March. The slide has now taken the regional banking gauge down 28% this year.

&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was quick to proclaim the current leg of the banking crisis “over” during a conference call discussing his bank’s acquisition of First Republic on Monday. He recommended everyone “just take a deep breath” even as higher interest rates and stress on the commercial real estate industry pose a threat to the banking sector.

&gt;“While FRC resolution is a good sign, we haven’t had a clear solution to the lack of confidence across regional banks and may need a more holistic response from regulators or the government,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Herman Chan said in a message.

&gt;Western Alliance and PacWest are among a number of regional banks investors zeroed in after Silvergate Capital Corp., SVB Financial Group and Signature Bank collapsed in quick succession and demonstrated the threat posed to commercial lenders by asset-liability mismatches and uninsured deposits.

&gt;But both companies posted earnings results in April that appeared to appease investors, with both firms indicating their deposit bases had stabilized or recovered after initial outflows in March.

&gt;“It looks like JPMorgan’s deal for FRC gave us one day of calm for the banking sector. Regional banking stocks are still looking vulnerable until we see clear signs that emergency lending programs can go away,” said Ed Moya, Oanda senior market analyst. “Wall Street is wondering which bank could be the next one that needs a rescue and that is making it easy to pick on the other regional banks.”"|0.8|25|0|25|['Bancorp']

**(NASDAQ:IEP)**

* Icahn Enterprises (IEP) is an \~$18 billion market cap holding company run by corporate raider and activist investor Carl Icahn, who, along with his son Brett, own approximately 85% of the company.
* Our research has found that IEP units are inflated by 75%+ due to 3 key reasons: (1) IEP trades at a 218% premium to its last reported net asset value (NAV), vastly higher than all comparables (2) we've uncovered clear evidence of inflated valuation marks for IEP's less liquid and private assets (3) the company has suffered additional performance losses year to date following its last disclosure.
* Most closed-end holding companies trade around or at a discount to their NAVs. For comparison, vehicles run by other star managers, like Dan Loeb’s Third Point and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, trade at *discounts*of 14% and 35% to NAV, respectively.
* We further compared IEP to all 526 U.S.-based closed end funds (CEFs) in Bloomberg’s database. Icahn Enterprises’ premium to NAV was higher than all of them and more than double the next highest we found.
* A reason for IEP’s extreme premium to NAV, based on a review of retail investor-oriented media, is that average investors are attracted to (a) IEP’s large dividend yield and (b) the prospect of investing alongside Wall Street legend Carl Icahn. Institutional investors have virtually no ownership in IEP.
* Icahn Enterprises’ current dividend yield is \~15.8%, making it the highest dividend yield of any U.S. large cap company by far, with the next closest at \~9.9%.
* As a result of the company’s elevated unit price, its current annual dividend rate equates to an absurd 50.5% of indicative net asset value.
* The company’s outlier dividend is made possible (for now) because Carl Icahn owns roughly 85% of IEP and has been largely taking dividends in units (instead of cash), reducing the overall cash outlay required to meet the dividend payment for remaining unitholders.
* The dividend is entirely *unsupported* by IEP’s cash flow and investment performance, which has been negative for years. IEP’s investment portfolio has lost \~53% since 2014. The company’s free cash flow figures show IEP has cumulatively burned \~$4.9 billion over the same period.
* Despite its negative financial performance, IEP has raised its dividend 3 times since 2014. IEP’s most recent dividend increase came in 2019, when it raised quarterly distributions from $1.75 to $2.00 per unit. IEP’s free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion in the same year.
* Given that the investment and operating performance of IEP has burned billions in capital, the company has been forced to support its dividend using regular open market sales of IEP units through at-the-market (ATM) offerings, totaling $1.7 billion since 2019.
* In brief, Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors. Such ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one “holding the bag”.
* Supporting this structure is Jefferies, the only large investment bank with research coverage on IEP. It has continuously placed a “buy” rating on IEP units. In one of the worst cases of sell-side research malpractice we’ve seen, Jefferies’ research assumes in all cases, *even in its bear case*, that IEP’s dividend will be safe “into perpetuity”, despite providing no support for that assumption.
* Since 2019, one bank has run all of IEP’s $1.7 billion in ATM offerings: Jefferies. In essence, Jefferies is luring in retail investors through its research arm under the guise of IEP’s ‘safe’ dividend, while *also* selling billions in IEP units through its investment banking arm to support the very same dividend.
* Adding to evidence of IEP’s unsustainability, we estimate that IEP’s last reported indicative year-end NAV of $5.6 billion is inflated by at least 22%, due to a combination of overly aggressive marks on IEP’s less liquid/private investments and continued year to date underperformance.
* In one example, IEP owns 90% of a publicly traded meat packaging business that it valued at $243 million at year-end. The company had a market value of only $89 million at the time. In other words, IEP marked the value of its public company equity holdings 204% above the prevailing public market price.
* The mark is even more irregular given that IEP bought over a million shares of the company in December before immediately writing up the value of those shares by \~194% in the same month.
* In another instance, IEP marked its “Automotive Parts” division at $381 million in December 2022. Its key subsidiary declared bankruptcy a month later.
* IEP reported $455 million in “real estate holdings” in its most recent quarter. The reported values in this segment have been remarkably stable for years despite declining net income and despite including (i) the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, which was razed to the ground in 2021; (ii) a country club that became nearly insolvent in 2020 before ownership reverted to its members in 2021; and (iii) a lack of transparency on other assets and valuations.
* The irregular valuation marks fit a pattern: In January of 2020, UBS dropped coverage of IEP citing a “lack of transparency” following its research showing marks that were “divergent from their public market values”, among other issues.
* Beyond aggressive marks, Icahn’s liquid portfolio has continued to generate losses. Our analysis of Icahn’s latest December 2022 13-F filing indicates that IEP’s long holdings have lost \~$471 million in value year to date, despite the S&amp;P gaining \~9.2% in the same time frame.
* IEP disclosed that its investment fund had a 47% notional short bet in its December 2022 filings. Given the positive market performance, we estimate this short bet has contributed at least a further $272 million in year-to-date losses.
* Overall, we estimate IEP’s current NAV as being closer to $4.4 billion, or 22% lower than its disclosed year-end indicative NAV of $5.6 billion. The analysis suggests that units currently trade at a 310% premium to NAV, with an annual dividend rate of 64% of NAV.
* Tightening matters further, IEP is highly levered, with $5.3 billion in Holdco debt and maturities of $1.1 billion, $1.36 billion, and $1.35 billion due in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively.
* IEP’s debt covenants limit the company’s financial flexibility: IEP is not permitted to incur additional indebtedness and is only allowed to refinance old debt. With interest rates having increased, IEP will need to pay significantly higher interest expenses on future refinancings.
* Carl Icahn’s ownership in IEP comprises about 85% of his overall net worth, according to Forbes, giving him limited room to maneuver with his own outside capital. We have assessed that Icahn has little ability or reason to bail out IEP with a capital injection, particularly at such elevated unit prices.
* Further underscoring Icahn’s limited financial flexibility, he has pledged 181.4 million units, \~60% of his IEP holdings, for personal margin loans. Margin loans are a risky form of debt often reliant on high share (or unit) prices.
* Icahn has not disclosed basic metrics around his margin loans like loan to value (LTV), maintenance thresholds, principal amount, or interest rates. We think unitholders deserve this information in order to understand the risk of margin calls should IEP unit prices revert toward NAV, a reality we see as inevitable.
* Given limited financial flexibility and worsening liquidity, we expect Icahn Enterprises will eventually cut or eliminate its dividend entirely, barring a miracle turnaround in investment performance.
* Overall, we think Icahn, a legend of Wall Street, has made a classic mistake of taking on too much leverage in the face of sustained losses: a combination that rarely ends well."|0.91|455|0|455|[]

Before leaving state service I believe I calculated that with 14 years I'd only be entitled to approx 1000 a month pension (until I die)... while not being that ""bad"", I am trying to get the most out of it... downside to taking it out of the state is god forbid I ever have to return to state service, i'd have to pay it all back to reinstate my seniority etc.

t3_135cdau|1683005821.0|investing|JP Morgan Acquires First Republic Bank: A Home Run Wrapped in Modesty|"Hey r/investing! I recently read an article about JP Morgan's acquisition of First Republic Bank and thought I'd share my thoughts on the matter.

According to the article, JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum emphasized that the deal was not a fantastic one for their company, but rather a ""modest"" one that they took on out of a sense of duty. However, it seems like JP Morgan might be downplaying the actual benefits of this acquisition.

Here's a quick rundown of the deal:

* JP Morgan acquired $185.8 billion in assets from First Republic, including $29.6bn in securities, $150.3bn in loans, and $5.9bn of other items.
* In return, they assumed $172.8 billion in liabilities, consisting of $92.5bn in deposits, $28bn in Federal Home Loan Bank debt, $50bn in FDIC funding, and $2bn of other items.
* JP Morgan also made a cash payment of $10.6 billion to the FDIC.

This puts the ""modest"" accounting gain at a few billion dollars, which doesn't seem too shabby. But what's more interesting is the earnings power that this acquisition brings to JP Morgan.

The acquired loan book, which now holds loans at a discount to face value, provides a decent yield. Additionally, the FDIC takes on 80% of the losses in case of defaults, which reduces the amount of capital JP Morgan has to hold against the loans, ultimately increasing its profit margin.

Another intriguing aspect of the deal is the $50 billion in five-year fixed-rate funding from the FDIC. This helps lock in a good spread on the loans through 2028, and the structure of the loans ensures a profit for JP Morgan in the years following.

Although JP Morgan claims the deal will add around $500 million in net income annually, it seems they're being conservative with their estimates, as First Republic generated net earnings at an annualized rate of over $1 billion in its last reported quarter.

Overall, it appears that this acquisition is indeed a home run for JP Morgan, despite their insistence on its modesty. The FDIC may have taken a $13 billion hit on the deal, but with limited bidders capable of handling First Republic's balance sheet, it's clear that JP Morgan was in a strong position to take advantage.

As for the broader market, this deal raises questions about the potential stagnation of margins. If margins were to flatline, investors might have to accept less earnings growth than they've become accustomed to over the long bull market. This could be an important factor for investors to consider moving forward.

All indicators are that it would be really, really bad for the economy.

The details that I can find from this deal seem to be that JPM pays $10.6 billion in cash to the FDIC. For that it gets

Liabilities: $90 billion deposits, of which it will repay asap $30 billion (including $5 billion to itself) of the big banks' attempted rescue deposits, presumably using the bulk of $50 billion in financing provided by the FDIC at an undisclosed (i.e. not very high) interest rate.

Assets: $170 billion in loans and $30 billion (par value) in securities. So the bonds make up about 15% of the assets

So JPM is basically paying $100 billion (plus some amount of interest on the $50B of financing) for $200 billion in nominal assets, 85% of which is loans, 15% of which is securities. Seems reasonable to say then that JPM is essentially paying $85 billion for the loans and $15 billion for the securities.

Obviously the securities have a market value way below par. Somewhere around 60%-70% of par at the moment. 60% of $30 billion is $18 billion. So JPM is paying $15 billion for $18+ billion worth of securities. Can this really be called a loss? Obviously interest rates could continue to move higher and the market value of the bonds could continue to fall, but this seems like JPM is getting a lot of value.

Is it interesting to buy with the actual prices since that maybe in one or two decades the prices could be divided 10 times or more ?

- Robotics can make paying building workers so much cheaper which will affect the final seelig price.

- An AI which can pilot this 3D printer can easily do the full job of building.

t3_134ogct|1682952324.0|investing|Real Estate in the US: Systemic Risks|"Fresh data on commercial real estate has been released, and frankly, it's no laughing matter. The proportion of unoccupied space recently hit a 5-year low.

This comes after recently discussing the risks associated with this sector.

What else can we expect?

🔺 US commercial property prices are falling amid rising interest rates. This has particularly affected office buildings: not everyone has returned to the office after COVID, and the vacancy rate in rented spaces hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels.

🔺 Prices for some properties have dropped by 25-30% or more. Recent data shows that commercial real estate in Californian cities such as Santa Ana and San Francisco is up for sale at discounted prices compared to just three years ago—30-60% off, depending on the age of the buildings.

🔺 The main issue is that most commercial real estate has been purchased on credit. In the next two years, according to some estimates, around $1 trillion in mortgage loans will require refinancing.

There are serious concerns that banks will be very reluctant or even unable to refinance troubled borrowers.

Why? **First, banks have their own full plate of problems.**

🔹 US commercial banks hold $4.2 trillion in Treasury bonds and other government securities. For large banks, these assets make up nearly 24% of their portfolios on average, while for smaller banks, it's 15%.

🔹 Additionally, banks hold a significant portion of their assets in commercial bonds. This is largely to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements.

🔹 The decline in the market value of these assets due to raised interest rates has seriously reduced banks' ability to return funds in the event of a run on deposits.

🔹 Small and regional banks were the largest source of credit for the industry last year. Following the recent bankruptcies of SVB and Signature, depositors withdrew some of their funds, and these banks will be less willing to provide financing.

❗️ Now, the most important part – providing credit for office real estate, for example, is extremely risky today. The collateral consists of the very square footage that is dropping in price. Moreover, in some cases, the value of the collateral is already significantly lower than the volume of loans issued against it.

If, or more accurately, when some borrowers fail to meet their obligations, banks may start going bankrupt. **This wave of bankruptcies appears INEVITABLE**. Similarly, as will be the case for developers.

The FDIC won't have enough money to save all banks, and in the worst-case scenario, they will focus on systemically important ones.

Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) that won't receive payments will plummet. This, in turn, will spread panic among CMBS holders and increase the likelihood of bankruptcies for issuing banks. Of the aforementioned $1 trillion needing refinancing, \~30% is backed by CMBS.

The stock market will slump, and spreads will rise to levels exceeding those during the COVID era.

Do you think everything described here is just a theoretical picture? Let's talk about it in a year.

Nevertheless, I believe that a major systemic crisis comparable to 2008 will likely be avoided. There is both experience and a difference in scale. However, the recession that is currently only being threatened is inevitable and will drag on for a long time. And the real estate sector could very well be one of the most problematic in this situation.

It's hard to predict what the Federal Reserve will do in such a situation. Interest rates may need to be lowered, but any compromise between growth, unemployment, and inflation will be less favorable than the situation during the COVID era.

Global markets will also feel the impact.

✔️ Initially, due to a slowdown in lending rates and a general reduction in the money supply,

✔️ Later, when the recession starts to gain momentum and energy resource prices fall, the impact may intensify.

*And you ask – why do I see a very real possibility of the S&amp;P dropping to the 3200 level? There is a chance. The question is only a matter of timing. Although it is unlikely to happen quickly and all at once.*"|0.78|48|0|48|[]

I could really use your insight on a potential investment opportunity. I'm from North Macedonia and have a budget of around €150,000-€160,000 to invest. I've been considering purchasing an apartment in Thessaloniki, Greece, to rent out throughout the year. The average rent in the area ranges from €500-€700 per month, and the property market seems to be on the rise as time passes, which could lead to an increase in apartment values over time.

Aside from the potential returns on my investment, I'd like to provide my parents with €200 from the rental income each month to help improve their quality of life. Moreover, the close proximity of Thessaloniki to North Macedonia would make it easier for me to manage the property if necessary.

However, I'm concerned about the potential impacts of climate change on Greece and whether it could affect the value of this investment in the long run. Additionally, I'd appreciate any thoughts you have on investing in rental properties in general and whether you think this is a smart move or maybe propose some other options in other areas.

Here is the issue: we need to park a good amount of money (way over the $250k) for about 4-6 weeks and I am worried about keeping it all on a regular bank account because of Silicon Valley bank, etc. 

In the past I did CDARS where my bank would distribute the money over several different banks in tranches of $250k each and therefore it would all be FDIC insured. However this process isn’t practical for a month or so since it takes about a week for it to be deposited and the shortest time period is about one month. 

So I currently have two ideas:

1. open an account with Chase (too big to fail) and just keep the cash there
Or 
2. Put it into my Schwab or Interactive Brokers account and buy a super short term fund or something like that with a AAA risk. 

Does anyone know any good money market type funds that are super short ans therefore have very limited interest rate risk?

t3_1313zp8|1682624743.0|investing|Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is Trading 140ish Now But the Fad Stock of 2020 is Still Being Chased by Retail Investors. You Cannot Outrun a Falling Star|" Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) became a fad stock when it more than doubled its IPO offer price of $120 and closed at $245 in September 2020. Then, in mid-November 2021, SNOW rose to $390 -- that was an increase of 225% from the IPO offer price and made many investors giddy. One such investor was Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), which bought SNOW at the offer price and still holds $900 million worth of SNOW shares: as many realize, however, this is a tiny, tiny stake for BH and amounts to just 0.3% of the portfolio. It is believed that one of Buffett’s lieutenants, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, may be behind the selection and not Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger. The stock now trades 140ish, down 44% from the IPO closing price; those who bought in Nov. 2021 at $402 are down 65%. Only those who got in at the IPO offer price of $120, like BRK, are still in the money. Still, the company has a market cap of $44 billion and is considered among leaders in the crowded, cloud-based software space.

***Share-based Compensation is Out of Control***

SNOW commands very high valuation metrics. The company is not EBITDA-positive yet but expects to be for the fiscal year ending (FYE) January 31, 2025 (FY2). Now, it's trading at 184x FY2 EBITDA. It has been free cash flow (FCF)-positive the last 2 years but that is after adding back stock-based compensation (SBC), which amounted to $605mm in 2021and $862mm in 2022.

Without the add-back, FCF is negative. FCF is usually calculated from net income by adding back SBC just like you're adding back non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization. That's how you erase the impact of SBC from FCF, which is the equity level (i.e., levered) FCF, unlike enterprise-level earnings measures like EBITDA and EBIT that are calculated on an unadjusted basis. However, even though SBC has no impact on actual cash flow, it will bite your share price when these shares vest and dilution hits.

SNOW is just out of control with its SBC, doling out insane amounts of shares to management and employees. In 2022, the total SBC accounted for nearly half (47.4%) of net sales and 29.1% of its total costs (that is, cost of sales plus operating expenses). By contrast, among SNOW’s peers, the typical SBC accounts for 22-26% of net sales and 20-22% of total costs. Snowflake is certainly an outlier in this regard.

What jumps out from this table is the disparity in “% of Net Sales” (47.4%) vs. “% of Total Costs” (29.1%). This figure for SNOW is striking at 47.4% vs. 29.1%: the 18.3% disparity contrasts with the comparable companies that are much closer together. What this shows is the magnitude of the loss that SNOW is reporting and the resultant lack of cost discipline in awarding such large amounts of SBC to employees. SNOW is one of the largest cloud-based companies when measured in terms of equity market cap ($45 billion) and total revenues ($2.1 billion). Yet it is doling out nearly half of its total revenues to SBC for employees. SNOW’s cost structure still resembles an early-stage company funded via venture capital reporting very little revenues and burning through cash reserves in an out of control manner.

The company expects a small base of EBITDA in 2024 (FY2); therefore, any earnings metrics below EBITDA will be negative. Currently, SNOW trades at 22x its $2.1b in LTM net sales and 16x its expected FY1 net sales of $2.9b. These are among the highest revenue multiples even for a cloud-based software company. However, revenue growth is estimated at 35-40% year over year in FY1 (2023) and FY2 (2024).

Looking at the financials, SNOW has some impressive growth metrics: the aforementioned sales growth rate is impressive and it enjoys working capital benefits from having customers prepay for services with its software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. There is very little capex and just a small amount of capitalized software; thus, depreciation and amortization are not material cash flow items.

***The Problem with SNOW’s Gross Margin and Scalability***

The issue, once again, is cost control, particularly SBC and the resulting dilution risk, and the growing concern about profitability and margins. While cloud-based software companies often enjoy 75%+ gross margins, SNOW is at 65%. To understand this, you need to look at the components of SNOW’s gross margin: aside from product sales which has a standalone gross margin of 65-72%, SNOW has a money-losing segment called “professional services and other” with a negative gross margin. Both margins are on an improving trend; however, when total revenues more than doubled as it did in FYE 2022, the gross margin for professional services worsened and only lessened losses a bit in the most recent fiscal year to -34%.

This is a labor-intensive business which helps customers migrate from legacy applications to SNOW’s platform. SNOW considers this type of customer care to be essential for customer retention. Indeed, even though this segment contributes to only 6.1-6.5% of net sales, it accounts for the majority of the revenue-generating employees at SNOW. These employees account for 55-59% of total such employees and the headcount for this business is 30% higher than those in the product segment.

The problem is that this particular segment does not seem to be very scalable: from 2021 to 2023, it has remained fairly stable at 6.1-6.5% of total revenues. In other words, while total net sales increased 249% from $554 million to $1.9 billion, the professional services segment still accounted for 6.1% of total revenues. Scalability seems to be somewhat limited for SNOW’s revenue-generating business model. While the overall gross margin could rise over time, it is questionable if it would ever rise to the level of its peers at 75%. Indeed, SNOW identifies the cost of this professional services segment as a significant risk factor in its 10-K:

*“If we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results … including our profit margins, will be harmed.”*

If the gross margin cannot go over 70% near-term, it could hinder SNOW from attaining sufficient profitability to grow its FCF meaningfully. In other words, SNOW’s growth strategy and the customer migration business model will hit the wall sooner or later without a meaningful increase in profitability.

***So How Much is SNOW Worth?***

Based on analyst projections and applying reasonable margins, SNOW could do about $700mm in unlevered FCF (sans SBC add back) in 2024. From this FCF base, we can estimate SNOW's FCF growing by 40% annually for the next 5 years using its discount rate of \~12-13%. The result is $80 in fair value for the stock; that's 43% below the 140ish stock price of recent days. This may seem harsh since the stock never traded that low in history (the lowest intraday recorded was $110.26 on June 14, 2022).

Well, those concerns were outlined above. If you consider other cloud-based software companies, the best positioned is Crowdstrike (CRWD), which has similar market cap, financials, growth rates and even stock price as SNOW: CRWD trades 130ish. I find its fair value to be \~$100, a discount of only \~20% from where it trades. CRWD has much better margins, has been growing quicker and is not hampered by SNOW’s the out-of-control and unwieldy cost structure: its gross margin averaged 74% the last 3 years and with the operating leverage accruing to its operating income and bottom line, the company seems to be ready to harvest meaningful inflow of FCF. Indeed, with a more disciplined cost structure, CRWD has been FCF-positive (without the SBC add back) since 2020. Financially, this is simply a much better-managed company than the fad stock of 2020 basking in its afterglow.

t3_130w8fs|1682614600.0|investing|Opinions on Bond Market Funds|"In theory, the final bond rate rise is coming in May, with the rates to then be held there until inflation is either down to 2% or something breaks, whichever is first. With that in mind, I'm considering getting big into bond funds, and want to see what people think about the overall premise. With the yield curve being inverted as it is, I would target 5-10 year bond funds, as their rates would be the most likely to change if the yield curve uninverted. 

It seems that the following scenarios are possible:

1) rates are raised in May and held there for some time. As long as you get into bond funds at after the last rate raise, it is likely that they would continue to hold their value and provide their dividends. Equities would likely suffer or stagnate during that time due to the high interest rates, making bond funds a compelling risk-adjusted choice.

2) rates are raised in May and then dropped shortly after due to recession or banking breakage. In this scenario, bond funds purchased before the rate drop would appreciate significantly in value, while equities would likely suffer. You would be able to dump the bond funds after the risk free rate dips below 1% for significant profit and return that into equities to catch the upswing. 

3) rates are raised in May and then dropped shortly after due to recession, but for some reason that causes equities to rocket ship up. Seems like it shouldn't happen, but given what's happened in recent years it's very possible. Bond funds go up, equities go up meaning you lose on overall gain, but still come out ahead. 

4) rates continue to rise after May. Bond funds and equities suffer due to high interest rates. Bonds will either underperform equities if companies continue to post robust profits, or overperform if inflation begins to cut into their margins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I'm missing, or do medium-term bonds appear to be the superior option in pretty much every scenario in the current investing environment?"|0.72|3|0|3|[]

Anyway, it got me thinking about whether I would benefit more from just trying to pay off my house sooner. I bought in 2018 for $620k, and refinanced during COVID to 2.25% without affecting the maturity date. Current balance on the loan is ~$550k. 

Using a simple online IRA calculator, with annual contributions of $6k, average return of 5%, and retirement age of 65, it’s estimating about $1M in the account by that time. If I were to forego future contributions and instead put that $6k per year into paying off my mortgage, will it yield a better return in the long run? It sucks to see that over half of my monthly loan payment is going towards interest and escrow, so it really makes me want to focus on paying that down.

t3_130epdn|1682585731.0|investing|My framework for stock analysis|" 

1. Understand the company and how it generates revenues. Which are the company's most attractive business units with the highest margins? Does the company have a competitive advantage relative to their competitors? E.g. can they manufacture goods more cheaply or with better quality?
2. Understand the competitive landscape and the industry's barriers to entry. How many competitors does the company compete with and is this increasing or decreasing over time? Is it easy for a new entrant to start competing in the industry?
3. Look at the track record of management, are there any dubious or shady figures involved? Have they successfully managed businesses in the past?
4. Scrutinize the balance sheet, make sure the company isn't over-leveraged. You can look at 'net debt / ebitda' here. If it is a high-growth company which is loss-making, how many years can the company continue to burn cash in this fashion? - You can look at the net cash position here and then compare with how negative the FCF is in a typical year. If it is a company with order flow, look at how many years or months of revenues does the backlog cover.
5. Valuation: for mature businesses, you can look at the next-twelve-month's PE - is this in line with its historical average or does it look stretched / depressed? For high-growth businesses, you can look at next-twelve-month's EV/ Sales or EV/ EBITDA, however, make sure you don't overpay. Try to work out what the margins of the business will be once growth matures. Then work out what the normalized PE or EBITDA 5 years into the future for example to determine whether the shares are attractively valued.

Meta's first-quarter sales rose 3% from $27.91 billion a year earlier, after three straight periods in which revenue declined.

For the second quarter, Facebook parent Meta expects revenue of between $29.5 billion and $32 billion, while analysts were expecting sales of $29.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.

""We had a good quarter and our community continues to grow,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. The company is ""becoming more efficient so we can build better products faster and put ourselves in a stronger position to deliver our long term vision,"" he said.

Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for the metaverse, brought in $339 million in sales but logged an operating loss of $3.99 billion. The company added that operating losses in Reality Labs will increase this year.  

Net income companywide fell 24% to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $7.47 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Restructuring charges reduced Meta's earnings per share by 44 cents.

Meta said that total expenses for 2023 will be in the range of $86 billion to $90 billion. That figure includes restructuring costs that range between $3 billion to $5 billion.

Capital expenditures will remain in the range of $30 billion to 33 billion. That figure accounts for its increased artificial intelligence investments and its ad-supported products like the newsfeed and Reels, the company said.

The after-market rally further boosted a stock that's been on an upward trend since Zuckerberg announced in February that 2023 would be the company's ""year of efficiency.""

The shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, but were up 74% this year, prior to the earnings report. Including the post-report surge on Wednesday to over $234, the shares are up about 164% from their November 2022 low of around $89.

Investors have rallied around Zuckerberg's plans to slim down his company through a series of layoffs, resulting in some 21,000 expected job cuts.

As a new invested in my mid 50s I made the mistake of using some of the portfolio methods for an IRA when I chose mutual funds, ETFs and bonds in my taxable account.  Fortunately most of my money is still sitting in my money market fund.  My thoughts so far is 40% VOO, 10% FTEC, 20% VXUS, 20% VTMFX or AOA and 10% cash. I'll be using this as my biggest bucket for retirement in about 15 years.  
I was looking for an alternative to bonds for this account to save on taxes but still have growth.  Both VTMFX and AOA have been mentioned to me as ones to consider.  VTMFX is a MF with about 50% bonds included, AOA is an ETF with about 20% bonds included.  I currently have short treasury bills in this account.  Any thoughts on a choice between VTMFX or AOA for this spot in my taxable account?

I have $7000 invested with no goal for it. I could pull that and put it towards the house. This would put me 22 months ahead of schedule, and I could invest the new money and rebuild just the same. Which would save me 2222 including the interest difference.

Finally, I could do both. Doing both would put me 40 months ahead of schedule. Which would save me 4,040, plus all the interest.

Is it worth doing this? Or should I just invest the $70/paycheck and let that continue to move?

Bonus question, what do you use your brokerage investments for? I’ve never really had a goal for mine and the last time I sold was to pay off my car in late 2020.

Thanks for the input!

I have a question about stock buy backs.  More specifically not allowing them.

I was in a discussion and it was mentioned buybacks were started by Reagan.  I looked into this and it was a decision of the SEC to allow them.  It wasn't  legislation by Congress. 

For the last 20 years or so there have been calls to disallow stock buybacks.   Some are talking about legislation.  But wouldn't the SEC be able to reverse itself and not allow the buybacks, without  requiring legislation?  Maybe that's easier said than done.

1. AAPL Corp 2.4 May03’23. Current bid yield: 9.104%. Current ask yield: 4.794%. Closing price: 99.67

So this is a corporate bond for Apple, expiring 03/23 with a coupon rate of 2.4%, paid semi annually. How is there such a high yield when the price of the bond is almost at par value, and there is no risk of default? 
What does the bid yield actually tell you, if not the expected return you’d make?

In a more general view of bonds, is it the current bid yield which determines the annual returns, assuming you hold till maturity? 

Also, if you believe interest rates are going to go down, am I right in thinking bonds will rise in value? Is there a way of calculating how much they can/will rise in value or is it completely supply and demand

We know that journos are not financial analysts nor should they pretend to be. But they continue to do so with impunity. There are so many low-quality articles being written on investing and stock-picking that sometimes you feel compelled to refute them.

The above-linked article in InvestorPlace was carried by YahooFinance and came to my attention. It's a short piece on Buffett's stock picks written by a journo masquerading as some kind of stock picker. Once you examine the article and the places he's worked at, it's immediately obvious that this is a liberal arts major with no financial training who is clueless about financial statements and market data.

The article starts out by opining that Buffett bought many cyclical stocks in 2022. Then he opines that investors should ""emulate the Oracle of Omaha and snap up"" 3 Buffett stocks which may outperform the market. The stocks he has in mind are (1) Bank of America (BAC), (2) American Express (Amex), and (3) Louisiana Pacific (LPX). Let's just examine BAC since it will take too much effort to refute all three and waste time on this imbecile.

Regarding BAC, the journo notes it's trading at $27.90 (at the time) which is ""unjustified"" as BAC is a large bank that will ""benefit from deposit inflows because of worries about smaller banks."" BAC is large so will attract deposits from smaller, regional banks. So he observes BAC's earnings will rise from $3.19 in 2022 to analysts' estimate of $3.39 in 2023. Well, here's the problem: first, that's a modest 6.4% EPS growth year over year and that's good. But $3.39 is also the estimate for 2024. In other words, analysts are projecting no earnings growth from 2023 to 2024. Why do you think that's the case? That's because they expect no revenue growth from 2023 to 2024: in fact, they are projecting a revenue decline from $100.93b to $100.89b. In other words, they are projecting a standstill scenario for BAC which is more than likely a modest banking recession taking place near-term. Btw, this isn't some secret that is being guarded by the keepers of Bank America's flame: this can be gleaned from any public site like YahooFinance compiling analyst estimates:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC)

But you would not know this from the misrepresentation that earnings growth is impressive and that, given this growth, the stock price is ""unjustifiably"" low.

Let's dig deeper into this misleading claim the stock price is ""unjustifiably low."" Since this journo can't do research himself, he quotes other financial sites and claims BAC has dropped below $30 “for the first time since 2020, as Barron's cited.” I don't think he even looked at the graph himself, which should have been part of his due diligence. BAC dipped below $30 in January and February of 2021: that is, the closing prices registered were lower than $30 on at least 3 trading days during that span; intraday-wise, BAC's stock price was below $30 on at least 6 days out of the first 20 trading days in 2021. I know, because I used to watch BAC.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

Then, BAC rose to a high of $49.38 in Feb 2022, which may have given impression that BAC was flying high and anything below $30 is abnormal. But this is how cyclical stocks, which banking stocks are, often behave, even a Systemically Important Bank (SIB) such as BAC.

Plus, when the journo claims the price dropping below $30 is so unprecedented, he implies that BAC must have been trading well above $30 for much of the last 5 years. That is not so either. Except for the 15-month period between March 2021 and May 2022, BAC traded in the low 30s. Prior to 2021, the stock was even under $18 and opened and closed below $20 in March and April of 2020 -- that was only 3 years ago. BAC was indeed a low-20 stock for much of 2020. That's what you call cyclicality and happens to even the largest commercial bank in the world.

Notice the guy doesn't cite financials since he can't. So he focuses instead on market data and graphs but even gets that part wrong. Remember when there was a tech wreck in 2000 (not 2020): that's when journos started masquerading as analysts and started touting Internet stocks like CMGI and coined terms like B2B, B2C, ""killer apps"" and ""category killers.""  It's been more than 20 years. But the same thing is happening again. It doesn't matter whether you like or don't like Buffett's stock picks. The same journos are churning out low-quality articles replete with misinformation and are passing themselves off as analysts. The inmates are running the asylum again."|0.94|290|0|290|['InvestorPlace']
t3_12vh093|1682192832.0|investing|Market Cap + Dividend strategy, would this work?|"Hi everyone

**I. Disclaimers:**

1. I'm rather new to this sub and investing in general, and English is not my first language. This thread may be totally nonsensical and I am sorry if it turns out to be. But I hope to receive constructive criticisms because I wish to learn more from you guys.
2. I have a very limited coding background so I couldn't run a backtest on this strategy that I am proposing. I am hoping if you guys could help me verify if this investing strategy would have worked in the past.
3. Before I start, I have tested against SPY, SCHD and QQQ for a period of 2015-2023 on portfolio visualiser and my strategy seems to work. But the test wasn't extensive as I couldn't have a dynamic data to rebalance the % overtime, it would be a bad idea as I found out NVIDIA was not among the top LargeCap but they climbed tremendously over the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Short hand notations:**

1. I will use basic short forms like **DCA**, for this post it would simply mean I invest **however much I could at the end of each month**, after sorting out other aspects of my finance.
2. Another set of short forms is LC for Large Cap, TLC for Top Largest Cap, **T1LC** is the **Top 1 Largest Cap**, T2LC for the Top 2 Largest Cap, and so on.
3. Suffice **wD** would mean **with Dividend**. T1LCwD would mean the Top 1 Largest Cap company that pays Dividend.
4. Prefix **a** would mean adjusted. I will introduce this concept in **III.A.** right below.

&amp;#x200B;

**III. So here is the strategy:**

**A. Rules and Criteria:** (I am probably using Excel to manually do this, please let me know if there is a better way. I really regret not taking my 3 years of uni Statistics seriously.)

1. I would update the data every month before the event I mentioned in **II.1**
2. I would take the Current Market Cap Total \* (1+DividendYield%) to get Adjusted Current Market Cap Total for each stock.
3. Sum up the Adjusted Current Market Cap Totals.
4. Find out the % weightage of each stock.
5. Resort them if needed. T1LCwD may not be the same as aT1LCwD because of the multiplication factor in 2.

I will explain deeper in part **B** (and even reset the rules because I don't have a large sum of money to buy all of these stocks).

*Note:*

1. *As aT1LCwD may cause confusion, I will sometime use* ***T1*** *instead.*
2. *I choose stocks wD because I noticed that these are relatively more stable than stocks woD, please counter me if it's dangerously wrong.*
3. *Even in bad crises, yeah you know the rest.*

**B. Algorithm:** (This is a crude skeleton of the plan, I will ignore trading fees for the time being)

1. I will buy 1 T1.
2. a. If buying a T2 will exceed the holding % than 1 T1 %, I will buy 1 more T1 and come back to Step 2.  
b. If buying 1 T2 does not set my T2 at a higher holding % than my T1, buy 1 T2 and proceed to Step 3.
3. Iterate the steps for T3 and continue until my deposit depletes.
4. In the next month, check if there is any changes to the % on Excel, and carry on the algorithm.

&amp;#x200B;

**IV. Additional takes:**

1. The math in **III.A.2** can be modified using Machine Learning to optimise the model. Again I really regret not taking my stats course seriously so I can only use wishful thinking here.
2. This idea is completely opposite to the mean-reversion DCA strategy, where you invest monthly in an index, a bit more when the price drops, a bit less when the price increases. This was shared with me by a friend who I deem very smart and quite knowledgeable. But I find happiness in creating new ideas.
3. This is somewhat a self-correcting algorithm, in the case a new company is rising, it would include and increase the position. The companies that fall off will not yet be sold, they may bounce back.
4. I am aware that Fundalmental &gt; Technical and I should spend more time reading up financial reports and news.  I understand that, but I want to focus more time on my other aspects in life as the time goes by.
5. For some reason, when I tested with JNJ and it seems to be not too effective with this Dividend King. I will update on this if I can think of a reason why."|0.33|0|0|0|[]

Which yield rates should I actually be looking at? 7-day? YTD? Yield? (and can anybody tell me what that means? Yield over what period?)

UPDATE 2: Reseraching some more, I think that PERHAPS one confusion stems from the fact that some yields are showing the 'DIVIDEND' yields, whereas some are showing overall yields.

Also something to consider, is that you don't know if you will have losses later that will offset the gains, which makes it a bit tricky.

Couple options I was thinking about:

1. Self withhold 30%, Open a separate cash brokerage account, throw it into some treasury securities or a MMF/TFLO/USFR
2. Self withhold 30%, Put it in a hedged equity etf or fund (to mimimize downside risk). If you have a net loss here, just cough up money from somewhere else tax time
3. Throw it in a hysa (prefer not, as its a pain keeping it in a completely different account)
4. Buy some CDs/bonds that expire around tax time

t3_12uum49|1682137852.0|investing|Novice retail investor: question about an a volatility investing strategy I came up with?|"I don't know if this is a completely original idea. It probably isn't. But I was learning a bit about how volatility indexes work. Specifically, an index like uvxy.

A lot of these volatility indexes reduce in value significantly over the course of time. Sometimes even losing about 90% value over the course of a given year.

I was trying to think about ways that I could take advantage of this and remembered about something called the Martingale betting strategy, which basically involves doubling your bets every time you lose. The idea behind this betting strategy is that you eventually always win, but it requires essentially an infinite pool of money because it's not realistically possible to double your bet multiple times.

Well, this becomes realistically feasible with volatility indexes.

The idea that I had involves purchasing a specific dollar amount's worth of volatility index shares and continuing to purchase that same set amount of money's worth of shares every time the volatility index reduces in value by 50% or more.

For example, buy $1000 worth of shares of uvxy at $10 per share = 100 shares. Then spend $1000 again at $5 per share = 200 shares, and so on and so forth. This essentially would lead to somebody having thousands and thousands of volatility index shares for paying a sort of ""flat fee"" every few months. Even with reverse splitting being a thing that exists, it would still seemingly be beneficial to do this if feasible for you. 

This essentially makes it so that you don't need to have an infinite amount to money to realistically implement the Martingale betting strategy because you can buy double the amount of shares instead of doubling the amount of money that you spend.

Another possibility could be to consider the historical volatility of the index and set the threshold based on the standard deviation of the volatility. For instance, if the historical volatility of the index is 20%, setting the threshold at 2 standard deviations (40%) could potentially capture significant market movements while reducing the risk of false positives.

By setting the threshold based on the standard deviation, you could adjust the threshold to be more or less conservative depending on the current volatility of the index. This means that in times of high volatility, you could set the threshold higher to potentially capture larger gains, while in times of lower volatility, you could set the threshold lower to potentially avoid unnecessary losses.  

The reasoning behind this is that if the stock's volatility exceeds this threshold, it is likely experiencing a significant deviation from its normal behavior, and it may be a good time to buy in at a lower price. By setting the threshold based on standard deviation, you can adjust for changes in volatility over time and potentially increase your chances of buying low and selling high.

Essentially, this means that if the market ever crashes, you will make a significant amount of money.

So far, I am only able to see two downsides to this:

1) you continue to bleed money in the long run until the stock market crashes which is the only time you would ever make money.

2) said strategy relies on the assumption that the stock Market will crash, which we all know will inevitably be true, but such a mindset is unhealthy for capitalism and the overall economy.


One potential benefit I see if this type of strategy catches on though is that, if retail investors utilize this strategy en masse, it would theoretically scare large whales and billionaire investors in the market  into stopping the stock market from crashing periodically every few years for fear of losing their investments. Ironically, this seems like it would result in more market stability as more retail investors catch on and use this type of strategy. 

My questions to you all are: 

1) am I insane? Or does something like this actually make sense? 

2) what are other downsides to this? 

I'm genuinely interested in learning more about stuff like this and the logic behind it so any feedback would be much appreciated.

If this strategy doesn't yet exist, I would propose to call it Volatility Vanguarding."|0.67|1|0|1|[]

But, why is that good? If you lost $200,000 on an investment, while gaining $400,000 in another investment, you simply made $200,000 for that period, so you're being taxed on less income. 

So I guess to simply this question:

**Scenario A**

* Investment A sold, makes $400,000 - Cost Basis $200,000
* Investment B sold, loss of $200,000 - Cost Basis $400,000
* Net Profit: $200,000

t3_12u8tig|1682092498.0|investing|Navigating Market Uncertainty: A Bearish Outlook Amid Debt, Inflation, and Geopolitical Tensions|"The prevailing market trend remains steady, reflecting a continuation of the recent pattern: a slight and predictable market weakness. Currencies are almost unchanged. **DXY** is hovering around typical levels, (although there are noticeable attempts to grow, we haven’t seen any dramatic changes). Yesterday, the market tried to decline, but the movement was limited to a half percentage point rollback.

A few words about gold: **Gold** is trading in the range of $1980-$2005. Personally, I still believe it's too early to sell or buy in the current market situation. If positions are open, the most reasonable approach would be to wait. Why? I think it would make sense to sell gold either from levels in the $2200-2300 range or from $1975 and below. Lately, we've seen three runs to the highs, followed by an inevitable rollback. Next time, gold might face stronger resistance and decline sharply. However, if we see a breakdown of these levels, we may witness the closing of short positions and potentially a significant short squeeze. I think there's a 50% chance here. Thus, there's no need to rush. If you've been in gold for a while, you've likely made good money already, and now you just need to wait for the right moment to exit positions. However, **if gold falls below $1975, it'll be necessary to close positions and lock in profits.**

What do we think about **UST**? Yields recently jumped to the 3.60-3.62% level. Now they've pulled back a bit, so **TMF** and **TLT** have risen again and will likely continue to rise. We made a small gain, increased our position, and now we're awaiting further developments.

Our strategy is to avoid taking any unnecessary actions. We also have short instruments, which are slightly increasing in price. We won't touch our gold positions. Lastly, we have ten-year UST positions, which provide modest profits. Overall, no drastic changes.

Globally, I view the market from a bearish perspective. I believe we could see movements in the near future driven by several factors:

* Debts that may lead to defaults
* Further growth of interest rates. 

Recent UK statistics showed **that inflation isn't declining**, which means central banks, including the Fed, will continue tightening monetary policy, leading to new problems in the financial sector. So past issues persist.

However, there are additional factors that could be strong triggers for declines. Another round of hassle around the debt ceiling is an important factor that can't be ignored. When senators - Democrats and Republicans - agree to raise the national debt ceiling, **this will lead to a massive increase in borrowing in the markets, which will result in additional liquidity being washed out of the market, plus inherent increased volatility**. I expect it to come within a month.

We also can't exclude the factor of **geopolitical uncertainty**. I believe that problems will emerge globally in the near future - in Europe, along the US-China line over Taiwan, in the Middle East, in Africa, and so on. Although this factor is less important than more direct domestic concerns, it could always rear its ugly head at some unexpected moment."|0.63|11|0|11|[]

There's so much more selection, better rates, and it's way easier than opening accounts with different banks! I have some questions about tax treatment, though.

Specifically, I'm looking at 1-year CDs that only pay coupon at maturity. In other words the first coupon payment is in 2024, when the CD matures. (Most other CDs have coupon payments monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually.)

**Question 1:** Since no interest payments are credited in 2023, does that mean that all the interest earned will be taxable in 2024, not in 2023? In a CD with monthly coupon payments, the interest is taxable along the way, ""as earned"". But if the only coupon payment is in April 2024, doesn't that mean it's only taxable in 2024?

**Question 2:** Does that mean this is an effective way to defer interest income into 2024, if I think my tax bracket will be significantly lower in 2024 than in 2023?

**Question 3A:** Since this is a Brokered CD, I can sell it at any time. Let's say I have $10,000 in a 1-year CD maturing on April 1 2024 with 5% interest. On March 31, the CD is 1 day away from receiving a $500 interest coupon. Doesn't that mean that if I sold it on March 31, I would get $10,500 for it? (Assume interest rates have stayed the same so the CD is otherwise trading at par.)

**Question 3B:** If I sold it for $10,500 right before the coupon payment at maturity, doesn't that ""transform"" the $500 from interest income to capital gains income? Which would automatically drop the tax rate?

t3_12twdsd|1682070293.0|investing|Looking for EU bonds for DIY structured products|"I might be overcomplicating things, but hear me out. I'm EU based and looking to set up a portion of my portfolio as rolling DIY structured products. Idea is to buy EUR denominated bonds with a duration of just below 1Y (so no coupon payments) and take the difference between cost and face value to buy call spreads on single stocks that I have high conviction on with a matching (or slightly longer) expiry date. In theory, as long as I let the bonds mature, I would collect the initial investment plus the leftover amount (discount on face value) I used for call spread premiums. I get full downside protection and (capped) upside participation. I'd want to avoid FX fluctuations on the fixed income side, so the bonds would have to be EUR denominated. On the option side I'm flexible with regard to currency and it's most likely going to be denominated in USD, both due to individual stock choice and lower premium spreads. Having a rolling maturity date of around 1Y also allows me to stop reinvesting if I'll need the money. 


So ideally for lots of 10k EUR, I would get bonds yielding around 4% and have enough left over to buy a call spread for around €400. The problem is, of the relatively high quality EUR bonds that I can find for the appropriate maturity dates, it seems that most of them require a minimum face value investment of 100k per trade (at least at IBKR). This is sadly significantly beyond my capital allocation means. The spreads are also quite high, but I can be patient with getting the right fills. That said, my experience in bonds is quite limited. I understand the basic premise but have never purchased them before.


So my questions would be:

* Am I missing any major flaws/risks in the proposed strategy?

* Which bonds should I be looking at that could fit 10k or 20k lots? Is there a good, liquid alternative that yields 3-4%?

* Is there a simple way of FX hedging that I'm not seeing that would allow me to go for USD denominated T-bills instead?

I ran a simulation of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) into an S&amp;P500 ETF and compared it to the performance of Fixed-size Purchasing (FSP), and thought I might share some quick findings.

It was found that the rate of return (specifically, the IRR) was almost 1% higher for the DCA strategy. Over \~4 years, the capital gains for the DCA strategy was almost 3% higher than the FSP strategy.

**Point taken that the post is on the detail-rich side. For the tldr on in what situations this matters? Skip Methdology and read Key Findings and Updates. It may just influence your choice of ETFs.**

Dollar Cost Averaging: purchasing a fixed dollar amount periodically, regardless of price. More shares will be purchased when price is lower and vice versa. This tends to weight the portfolio such that its average cost basis is lower than the time-average of the underlying instrument. This is also easier to implement because retail investors typically have approximately the same dollar amount of disposable cash flow each month.

Fixed-size Purchasing: purchasing the same number of shares periodically, regardless of price.

# Methodology

&gt;!The instrument considered is the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (Ticker: VUAA.L), which is an Irish-domiciled accumulating fund that fully replicates SPX. Dividends are taxed at 15% and then reinvested into the fund automatically. The reason for using the VUAA.L is because I am not a tax resident of the U.S so an Irish-domiciled fund provides favorable withholding tax rates. This will not impact results qualitatively. The expense ratio of 0.07% per annum was taken into account.!&lt;

&gt;!A quantum of SGD 3000 was chosen to be invested into VUAA.L monthly in the DCA strategy. This includes all costs and fees of purchasing with an IBKR Pro Tiered account, which works out to about USD 1.9. At this size, trading costs as a percentage are near the minimum, and it was also relatively large compared to the price of each share.!&lt;

&gt;!The period of simulation runs from 1 Jun 2019 to 1 Apr 2023. Purchases were made on the 1st of each month.!&lt;

&gt;!For the FSP strategy, a fixed lot of 32 shares were purchased each month so that the total cost basis are as close as possible for the 2 strategies.!&lt;

&gt;!When calculating cost basis, all trading fees are included e.g market price = 100.00, trading costs = 1.90, cost basis = 101.90. The reason is that investors should be concerned primarily with their net cash outflow, not market price.!&lt;

&gt;!Because of the use of SGD, quantitative results are slightly but insignificantly influenced by the USDSGD rate. However, qualitative results are not affected.!&lt;

&gt;!I also wanted to find what was the expected effective annual yield one would get when purchasing SPX an an arbitrary time. To do this,!&lt;

1. &gt;!The time-averaged price of each year was taken. This would be the price one would expect to buy/sell the share during that year.!&lt;
2. &gt;!For each year, the effective annual yield required for the time-averaged price from 10 years ago to reach this year's time-averaged price was computed. This was termed the effective Trailing 10-year annual yield (eff. T10Y)!&lt;
3. &gt;!The arithmetic average of all eff. T10Y was computed to result in the Average eff. T10Y annual yield.!&lt;
4. &gt;!Only data from 1980-present was used!&lt;

&gt;!Average eff. T10Y yields for Treasuries were computed on the same principles, though exact steps differ.!&lt;

# Key findings

For the DCA strategy, a total of 1529 shares of VUAA.L were purchased at a total cost basis of SGD 138,680 at an average cost basis of SGD 90.72.

For the FSP strategy, a total of 1504 shares of VUAA.L were purchased at a total cost basis of USD 140,049, at an average cost basis of USD 93.12.

Less shares were received for a higher overall cost in the FSP strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

The internal rate of return (IRR) is the constant rate of compounding at which your portfolio would've arrived at the same present market value purchasing at the same dollar values and dates as you had. Think of it like the yield of a bond that you can purchase at any time in any amount, and this yield never ever changes. It is a good way of measuring the performance of your capital. The IRR can be computed by solving a high-order polynomial, or a simple search algorithm.

For the DCA strategy, the IRR was 6.14%.

For the FSP strategy, the IRR was 5.16%, 0.98% lower than the DCA strategy.

Over the 4 year period, the DCA strategy delivered overall 12.73% capital gains over cost basis compared to 9.81% for the FSP strategy, 2.91% higher.

IRRs may look depressed compared to averages because of current market conditions.

For the DCA strategy, the IRR is +3.78% over the average eff. T10Y Treasury annual yield, and -3..37% over the average eff. T10Y VUAA.L annual yield.

For the FSP strategy, the IRR is +2.82% over the average eff. T10Y Treasury yield, and -4.27% over the average eff. T10Y VUAA.L annual yield.

&amp;#x200B;

Would be happy to share data if anyone desires! Drop me a PM, since r/investing doesn't allow media.

**Updated with some insightful questions:**

* I have never heard of FSP.

FSP is just something I coined to refer to the practice of buying a fixed number of shares a month such that the total cost basis in a time period is equal to that of the DCA. It's an impossible strategy, which is why it isn't written about haha. To do so, one would require precise knowledge of future prices.

Mainly, FSP serves as a proxy to measure the internal rate of return of the VUAA.L index when sampled at monthly intervals. I thought that structuring it as a comparison of 2 strategies would provide more intuition about what the comparison means. The equivalent understanding of results is that DCA provides \~1% of outperformance over the internal rate of return of the security!

&amp;#x200B;

* Would the same conclusions hold up over other time periods?

The outperformance of DCA over FSP (or over the IRR of instrument) is trivially true, and can be seen from their formulae. However, the extent of outperformance will vary. I suspect that under conditions of 2010-2018, the extent of outperformance may be even greater. I would be happy to test a specific period for a specific instrument by request!

&amp;#x200B;

* In what situation would such information be helpful?

Generally, we're advised to go with the fund with the lowest expenses. Suppose you have $100 in cash to invest each month an ETF that costs $90 with an expense ratio of 0.07%. You would only be able to purchase 1 unit a month except in the 9th month, when you can purchase 2. As such, your strategy will be much closer to FSP than DCA, even though DCA is your intent. You might wonder how much growth you're giving up.

You might have an alternative investment (perhaps another ETF that tracks the same index) that has a way lower $5 unit cost, but has a marginally higher expense ratio e.g twice the expense ratio at 0.14%. At face value, most would decide in favor of the lower expense ratio, but the quantitative results suggest that - over the last 4 years at least - you would've been better off going with the higher expense ETF that allows you to DCA! Even under depressed conditions, the 1% outperformance works out to a 22% outperformance in terms of capital gains over 20 years. Not the biggest factor, by far, but not insignificant.

Another possibility is that Irish-domiciled ETFs may charge a 15% withholding tax on dividends, but that works out to less than 0.3% of total capital. If a US resident is able to DCA into an Irish-domiciled ETF, but not higher unit cost US-domiciled ones, then the Irish-domiciled ETFs could be a better choice despite additional taxes."|0.73|30|0|30|[]

2.  The cost of maintaining dominance in the wireless industry has been very high. AT&amp;T has spent $40 billion over the past three years on spectrum licenses, but this has not led to a significant increase in revenue.

3. AT&amp;T's massive debt load is a major concern. Even after spinning off WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T still has a high level of debt. This could make it difficult for the company to invest in its business and to return cash to shareholders

Bulls

1.  AT&amp;T Q1 revenue up 5.2%, 5G and fiber subscriber gains, with 424k postpaid phone net adds and 272k AT&amp;T Fiber net adds. Domestic wireless service revenues were up 5.2%, with best-ever first-quarter Mobility operating income. Consumer broadband revenues were up 7.3%, driven by AT&amp;T Fiber revenue growth of 30.7%. 

2.  After investing heavily in its network, AT&amp;T will have a nationwide 5G wireless network with deep spectrum and a fiber network that can reach nearly a quarter of the United States.

3. AT&amp;T is a leader in the telecommunications industry with a strong network and a loyal customer base, the company has the scale to remain a strong wireless competitor in the long run. With three dominant carriers, industry pricing should be more rational going forward"|0.62|8|0|8|[]

t3_12tdwxh|1682022106.0|investing|Lifecore: Opportunity or Bust?|"Been following Lifecore (ticker: LFCR) for the past few of days. I believe the stock is a compelling long but would appreciate some pushback.

Lifecore is an oddity in the pharma industry. It has two main business branches in two very different sectors. One is the CDMO business that manufactures injectables for drug companies. Another one is their commodity Curation Foods business. Salad, avocado, olive oil, etc. This combination makes no sense at all but if you ever read Joel Greenblatt's fancy title books you'd be intrigued by possible shift in business mix. Perhaps a spin-off or other corporate action would unlock shareholder value...

Well that's exactly what is happening right now. On March 16th, Lifecore made three important announcements.

1. 2023 Q2 results with 11% revenue decline, going concern notice, and statements on breach of covenants.
2. Expansion of contract with existing customer including 10m upfront payment in cash and up to 15m capex reimbursement.
3. Statement on looking for strategic alternative.

So what does this mean for the stock? First trading day after the announcement, the market reacted violently. The stock plunged 70%. High debt level combined with going concern notice and exploration of strategic alternative is almost never a happy marriage and it wasn't a great start. Moreover, in months leading to Q2 announcement, Lifecore issued a note telling investors that previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon due to errors found in its Curation Foods business. Doomed! Or so it seemed. Interestingly, the stock went up 80% on the following trading day and has since held its ground in $3-4 range despite reasonably high borrow fees for shorting this name. Perhaps there's more to the story.

I decided to go over the business this past weekend and found a few more interesting items.

1. The company has an activist investor on the board and has been selling off its Curation Foods business for the last few years. They sold their avocado segment this year and now olive oil sale completes the sale of Curation Foods segment. Prior to this sale, I believe this was the last remaining thorn in Lifecore path towards receiving forbearance from lenders as well as attracting the best possible bids. Lifecore is finally a pure CDMO play well positioned to capture bids from both financial and strategic buyers. These assets are highly valued and often trade at EV/EBITDA multiple of larger than 15 due to regulatory and technical reasons. Lifecore guided around 32.5 million before the meltdown and winning their largest contract to date would most likely push EBITDA run rate to \~40m.
2. The revenue decline only happened for non-material reasons. Their customer pushed the schedule back by a quarter or two and hence the quarter numbers looked disappointing. But this means next quarter or the following one should have higher than normal numbers.
3. The liquidity statement is most likely the result of covenant breach and they should have enough cash on hand to run the business. Why? They just sold their avocado business for 17.5m (goes into paying down debt) and got 38.75m in converts with $7 strike price. They have enough cash to run the business and fund their capex. My best guess is that miscalculating the timing of (2) probably had some impact on the covenants and they now need to negotiate the terms with lenders. Right now these debts are callable at any moment and that's probably why they needed to issue the liquidity statement. Technically, they don’t have enough cash right now to meet the theoretical obligations that could arise from accelerated debt payment. Does it make sense for creditors to call the debts? No. They are much better off letting the sale process go through and getting a kick back for granting forbearance.
4. They hired Morgan Stanley for their strategic alternative process. If Morgan Stanley is the Morgan Stanley I know, they would not advise companies on a tiny 6 million dollar deal that may or may not go through. It's not the olive oil deal that needs Morgan Stanley. This is most likely the sale of the entire company. For what it's worth, when I interviewed for Morgan Stanley internship a while ago, the interviewer told me that they don't look at deals below 500m--pretty sure they do look at smaller deals as well but guessing it's the minority. I went to buyside straight out of college so don't have any first hand experience there but is more or less in line with conversations I had with friends in bulge bracket banks. Moreover, Morgan Stanley advised on a similar deal last year when Alcami traded hands. Lifecore has the right advisor.
5. The interest level in CDMO asset is wild. They have been steadily growing and industry experts I've spoken to all agree that they are most likely getting dozens of bids right now. Given that board owns significant amount of shares and the company has set its sight on sale process, we have the right conditions for maximization of shareholder returns.
6. The short interest increased going into the belated Q2 announcement on March 16th and since then FINRA data suggests that good amount of shorting has taken place. Historically, high short interest led to poor stock performance but occasionally you see stocks like Gamestop and Tesla that totally burns the short sellers. Given that I believe LFCR is a misunderstood situation and borrow fees are relatively high, the elevated short interest offers more reason to yield significant return should forbearance be granted and going concern notice removed.

Why are some people short this name?

Short thesis for this name is fairly straightforward. You have a company with business not matching the debt structure. The loans are current and they don’t have sufficient cash to meet all obligations. They just issued 38.75m in convertibles and even then they breached the covenants so the future looks bleak. Short!

On the other hand, the value of CDMO asset and high borrow rate make such thesis highly risky for the shorts and favorable for those looking at this name from the long side. What is this worth? We can look at other CDMO transactions for some guidance. Somewhat recent rumors of Catalent buyout sent the expectation to almost 20x EBITDA. Pantheon and Cook Pharma were both acquired for around 17 times EBITDA. If you apply a more conservative 15x multiple and subtract net debt, you are looking at a $14-15 stock. Apply 20x and you have a $20 stock.

What I see is a catalyst rich stock with next earnings right around the corner trading far below any reasonable transaction price (note: given that they released their Q2 only a couple of weeks ago Q3 could be delayed by few weeks). Should going concern be resolved by then, I believe people will begin speculating on potential buyout and shorts would be in deep trouble. Why would you be short should lenders agree to forbearance and acquirer could multiples of current price?

Would appreciate any feedback you have. I’m long LFCR but if there’s anything I’m missing happy to know about it."|0.6|2|0|2|['Lifecore']

Anyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the ""VT with tendency to the value factor"". It is a ""fund of funds"" with the following composition:

* Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%)
* Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%)
* Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%)
* Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%)
* Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%)
* Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%)
* Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%)
* Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%)
* Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%)
* Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%)
* State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)

I got this information from the website [etf.com/avge](https://etf.com/avge). But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.

So, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:

* [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv): In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE).
* [avge-holdings-grouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-grouped.csv): This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\*42.78% + 2.98%\*15.05%).

And, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.

|Name|Ticker|Weight|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%|
|Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%|
|Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%|
|Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%|
|JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|JPM|0.80%|
|Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%|
|Merck &amp; Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%|
|Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%|
|Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%|
|Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|

The fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.

# Next goals (which I will do when I have time):

* Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT;
* Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily."|0.87|16|0|16|['\\[small']

My current portfolio value is below $300k, which is far less than it should be. I only became a high income earner in the past few years, so I got a late start to investing, and even more recent start to not market timing or gambling to “make up the difference”.

Back to the matter at hand, I bought $25k in I-bonds last year ($10k personal, $10k gift, $5k paper bonds from my tax refund). Even with expected drop in the 6-month rate starting in May, buying now would lock the current rate for the next 6 months.

He just kinda shrugged it off and said it’ll all be taxed heavy whenever I withdrawal anything for it as he stepped out to make a call

I haven’t been able to talk to him again about it yet but what’s y’all take on 401k investing? Should I lower my contribution and look into a different route with the rest of the funds? 

ETA: currently at 96k a year. I can safely expect 5% raise each year, a 10k bump either this summer or next and another 10k within the next five years. So I should be around 120k by 2028 and my position is limited to 140k.

t3_12s2hy5|1681923008.0|investing|Firearm manufacturing investing is riskier than you think.|"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind.

It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons:

1. People simply weren't buying the guns.
   1. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government).
   2. The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought.
   3. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year.
2. Didn't have money for requisite equipment.
   1. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc).
   2. Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid.
3. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated.
   1. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue.
   2. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices.

The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves.

In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades.

For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&amp;K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns.

High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through.

In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure.

This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change.

To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts.

However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly.

Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen.

The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad\*\*\* weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though.

To be fair, the guns that often make business sense are generally derided by all the men that know anything about guns. Case in point: Hi-Point guns are notoriously heavy and un-ergonomic but are accurate, reliable, and cheap. They did this by minimizing the number of parts that needed to be milled or had tight tolerance so they could use stamped sheet metal and plastic for most of the parts. This makes for a gun that nobody likes, but people buy anyway because it's really good at doing what guns do best: Sit in a drawer for decades just in case the owner has to deal with an \*\*\*hole someday.

In all good conscience, one cannot recommend any more than a market cap weighting of your investments to small arms manufacturers, which are less than 1% of the total market."|0.66|16|0|16|[]

Until recently, market participants favored the 60/40 strategy, with the negative correlation between the two assets serving as a hedge against market uncertainty. However, due to rising inflation and increasing interest rates, everything has changed.

Although the Bloomberg 60/40 Index is up 6.3% this year after falling nearly 17% in 2022, BlackRock strategists believe that bond yields depend more on stock returns, suggesting that the approach to investing in fixed-income assets needs to be revised.

Specifically, the bank plans to focus on inflation-linked bonds and short-term bonds. One unclear aspect is the timing. Judging by the CPI and PPI, price growth has slowed, and the Fed is close to pausing. Could it be that BlackRock analysts expect the U.S. to follow the same fate as the U.K. with regards to inflation?

According to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, the Federal Reserve could raise the rate all the way up to the 5.50%-5.75% range if new obstacles to price stability emerge. If this does in fact come to pass, a bet on the 60/40 strategy might not pay off.

Here’s is some insight on my situation. I am prior military and have invested, since my time in, roughly about 11,000 dollars into my TSP. I never paid attention to my TSP and left all of it in the G fund (cash reserve) during my entire time in active duty (shame I know). Now that I am out, I work a civilian job that has an employer 401k where I have approximately 5,000 dollars invested. The 401K is with the same brokerage firm where I have my other investments (minus the TSP) and the entirety of the 401K is invested in a retirement blend fund for 2065. I am leaving this job in about 3 months so my contribution to this 401K will also cease soon enough. So far these are the factors I am considering when contemplating this decision.

Move Funds:
1. Better compounding
2. Ease, all investments will be allocated to the same company
3. Chances are my next employer will provide a 401K with same brokerage company

Not Move Funds:
1. TSP allows me to move the invested amount between a wider array of funds and provides more freedom so I can diversify better. 401K is a set fund, can’t do anything with it

Obviously, I know it’s a long game and not expected crazy returns in only 8 months but you would at least expect at least some returns on a chunk of money like that and in 8 months.

I am having a difficult time understanding why mutual funds have to distribute capital gains instead of giving more of the fund in lieu of cash whereas ETFs can. Obviously, in a taxable account, this would be advantageous. Even though this is the case, I noticed that some mutual funds, especially Vanguard funds (VTSAX, VTIAX, VTWAX), avoid distributing capital gains, how can they do that?

t3_12pj0k6|1681742400.0|investing|The most crucial topic this week will involve corporate reports. Who are the leaders, and who are the laggards?|"Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.

I expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:

1️⃣ Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.

▪ **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.

2️⃣  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.

3️⃣ Energy and precious metals mining:

▪ Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.

▪ Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.

Laggards:

1️⃣ Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.

I'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.

Additionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.

2️⃣  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.

3️⃣  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.

Conclusion:

Adding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision."|0.63|6|0|6|[]

Weak macroeconomic  indicators and the threat of a recession, for instance, suggest a  possible revision of monetary policy.

On  the other hand, robust corporate earnings leave room for maneuver. In  simpler terms, better data has a tendency to delay any changes in the  Fed's tone. This is why USD and government bond yields surged on Friday.

Regarding  the prospects of a recession, the fact that truck traffic on China's  domestic highways is down 8% (W/W) and the U.S. anticipates a 2% drop in  demand by 2023 implies that deflation could accelerate even without the  Fed's assistance.

For more  insights, we need to rely on macroeconomic data. The Beige Book,  reflecting the regulator's assessment of the nation's current economic  situation, will be released on Wednesday. Additionally, Fed officials  Williams, Waller, Bowman, and Bostic are scheduled to give speeches  throughout the week.

Lastly, U.S.  budget negotiations could prompt further declines in the dollar. This  week, Republicans will attempt to ""sell"" the idea of eliminating the  federal debt ceiling and of reducing government spending.

In addition to this I also currently have a 2045 target fund in the  401k which I might convert to this target portfolio when I stop  contributing.

In addition to these  investments I also have quite a lot in cash equivalent assets (CD,  treasuries, MM, I-bonds) which I plan to partially DCA in the next 2  years (to give me comfort with doing FIRE in these crazy times) and  partially use for real-estate investment when I move to EU.

I  started to have second thoughts about allocation strategy since I\`m not  sure how much this portfolio could edge against USD loosing value to  EUR. I can make my worst case scenario assumptions for the cash  equivalent investments and probably the only reasonable thing to do is  to start converting USD to EUR for the short term needs (real-estate and  cash needed for next 3-5 years). However, I\`m not sure long-term how I  can be sure my portfolio could not drift too much when accounting for  USD/EUR conversion. I read that currency does not matter in the long run  but is this true only for the accumulation phase or also during  withdraws for retirement? My understanding is that allocating to  international stock is the easiest way to somehow mitigate this risk but  what about bonds? An additional complication is that I have double  USD/EU citizenship and I cannot invest in EU securities without  getting into complicated US tax issues. So I would prefer to keep my  money invested in an US brokerage. Is BNDX sufficient as a tilt and is  there an international equivalent of TLT (and would I need one)?  Any  other recommendation?

I started to study about it and even found [some studies that suggest using leverage in investments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k) depending on your age.

In these studies I found some criticisms about this type of approach, the main one being ""volatility decay"". In discussions (right here on reddit, for example) I see that most argue that leveraged ETFs are not for the long term.

Even with all the winds blowing to the side ""*Hey Victor, forget about it... leave it alone*"", I decided to do a test encompassing a huge period of time. As written in the title, I used a [dataset from 1927 to 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryhan117/sp-500-historical-data).

&gt;I found this [other dataset that has a history from 1871 to 2018](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/blob/master/data/data.csv). However, these are monthly and not daily closing values and since I would like to evaluate the behavior of the daily volatility decay, I decided not to use it to complement a longer period.  
&gt;  
&gt;I couldn't find a CSV containing the daily data for 2020 to date. However, I committed the [project on github](https://github.com/victornoleto/sp500-leverage) for those who want to either complement it with a more complete dataset or even check out the algorithm I used to calculate leverage.

**I'm confused about why someone would hold high dividend-yielding positions in an IRA.** (And maybe I have some doubts about dividends in general.) Here are two points I could think of in favor of dividend stocks in an IRA and what I think about them.

1 - Usually I hear ""dividends are desirable because they provide passive income."" But that's moot in an IRA since you're not cashing out on those dividends, at least for a while if you're young.

2 - But maybe there are other +1's as to holding high dividend positions in an IRA. For instance, if I choose to automatically reinvest my dividends, that's (semi)continuous interest, which maybe leads to substantial asset growth over time. **But something I've never understood -- are dividend payouts (even close to) large enough that the interest induced by reinvesting them could be comparable to the long-term growth of plain old stocks/funds/etc. (that are not ""high dividend yielding"" nor selected based on their dividend potential)?** Because if not, then this 2nd point is moot also--as far as accruing value goes, it would be better to just buy ordinary funds/stocks.

&gt;Charles Schwab Corp. stunned Wall Street in 2019 by slashing trading commissions to zero, forcing its competitors to adapt. The move amounted to a big bet that its bank — rather than its well-known discount brokerage — would keep driving profits.

&gt;For a while, it worked to perfection. The pandemic hit, interest rates were pinned near historic lows, and Schwab raked in billions as the fees it had forsaken were offset by what the company earned from its banking operation.

&gt;But last month’s collapse of three US banks, the industry’s worst crisis since 2008, has turned that wager on its head. 

&gt;Now Schwab, the biggest publicly traded US brokerage, faces one of the most painful moments in its 50-year history. After a rapid surge in interest rates, deposits sank while unrealized losses swelled. The stock plunged 33% in March, its worst month since 1987.

&gt;Investors will be looking for signs of Schwab’s longer-term prognosis on Monday, when it reports first-quarter results. In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts sharply reduced their profit estimates. 

&gt;Deposits are a key focus.

&gt;If they decline too far, Schwab could eventually be forced to sell securities at a loss. Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger, 62, and billionaire founder Charles Schwab, 85, issued two joint statements in recent weeks to reassure investors that there’s a “near-zero” chance of that. On April 6, they touted $53 billion of client assets that arrived in March, the second-largest for that month on record.

&gt;“What we’ll be most keen to see is: did the pace of deposits leaving accelerate?” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Neil Sipes. “Can they quantify how much more there is to go?” 

&gt;Some investors decided not to wait. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, which had been among Schwab’s top 15 shareholders at year-end, sold its entire $1.4 billion stake during last month’s turmoil, the Financial Times reported Friday.

&gt;“We didn’t see an existential risk but they were caught up in the sentiment around banks,” Mark Barker, head of international at the investment firm, told the FT. “With all the inflows to money-market funds Charles Schwab is losing deposits revenue.” 

&gt;Schwab defies easy classification. Known for pioneering cheap stock trading, it grew into one of the largest US banks. The firm weathered seismic changes over five decades, including the dot-com bust, the dawn of low-cost index products and the era of free trading it ushered in.

&gt;Cash has become even more important since then.

&gt;While the move to zero-fee trading paved the way for its $26 billion purchase of TD Ameritrade, it also knocked out an income stream that totaled $763 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in 2018.

&gt;Because Schwab generates most of its money from customer funds idling in low-yielding accounts — which it “sweeps” into its bank arm — the firm needed somewhere to invest incoming cash as trading surged. 

&gt;Like Silicon Valley Bank, the largest of the three lenders that imploded last month, Schwab plowed into debt that will take five years or more to mature. Such securities, backed by the US government, are supposed to be among the safest available — a seemingly good fit for a company known for its conservative approach to money-management.

&gt;The risk was that interest rates could rise. 

&gt;That’s exactly what started to happen in early 2022, as the Federal Reserve began to hike aggressively. The investments are now underwater, though Schwab won’t have to book a loss unless it’s forced to sell them. 

&gt;“We have taken relatively little risk in our portfolio,” founder Schwab and Bettinger said in a March 23 statement, noting that more than 80% of deposits are FDIC-insured. Two weeks later, they predicted that the migration to higher-yielding investments would ease. “That trend eventually reaches a plateau,” they said. 

&gt;Company spokeswoman Mayura Hooper said the firm offers many ways for clients to make the most of their cash.

&gt;“Cash sweep is just the starting point for uninvested cash at Schwab,” Hooper said in a statement. 

&gt;Whether the remaining deposits stay put will depend to a degree on the big independent advisers that buttress Schwab’s business. They’re increasingly focused on getting the best returns for clients’ cash.

&gt;Charles Sachs, chief investment officer at Kaufman Rossin Wealth, is among them. He moves customer money from Schwab sweep accounts into its higher-yielding money-market funds, on almost a daily basis.

&gt;“This is a frustration,” Sachs said. “It creates unnecessary work for us.” 

&gt;At Fidelity Investments some sweep accounts earn more than 4%, with no extra effort required. Schwab offers 0.45%.

&gt;“Nobody likes to be sitting, not earning money on your dollars when you could be,” Sachs said, adding that he complained to Schwab. “They’re going to need to do something.”

&gt;Jon Ulin, managing principal of Ulin &amp; Co., a private wealth adviser in Boca Raton, Florida, said that some clients have asked questions about Schwab’s balance sheet and plummeting share price. He said Schwab’s business is sturdy.

&gt;**“I don’t have any concern at all,” he said. “The US government would intervene if something got worse.”**

&gt;In January, Schwab told investors that it believed the firm can increase profitability in coming years as low-yielding assets mature, freeing it up to invest in securities with higher yields. But this strategy hinges on a number of assumptions, particularly that deposit flight will ebb.
 
 &gt;The firm’s leaders estimated in January that interest-earning assets had an additional 8% to 12% to fall from year-end levels, in part because they looked to the last interest rate hiking cycle, which ended in 2019, for a template.

&gt;They also assumed the firm’s high-cost borrowing would be temporary.

&gt;To shore up its business in the short term, Schwab has been relying on loans. The firm said it had $100 billion in cash flow and more than $300 billion available from the Federal Home Loan Bank system, among other options.

&gt;It has already drawn from that pool.

&gt;Schwab became the largest borrower from its local branch of the system, the Dallas FHLB, in 2022, according to regulatory filings. Schwab borrowed $12.4 billion from it last year, and an additional $13 billion so far this year, according to its annual report. 

&gt;Against that backdrop, Schwab continued to reward shareholders by increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.

&gt;Wall Street analysts are still confident in Schwab. Most have the equivalent of a “buy” rating on the company’s stock. In yet another sign of Schwab’s unique place in the US financial system, some analysts who cover it primarily focus on brokerages and exchanges — not big banks. In its scale and layout, Schwab remains a bit of an anomaly.

&gt;“They’re not a typical bank,” said Piper Sandler analyst Rich Repetto. “It’s a unique business model.”"|0.78|59|0|59|[]
t3_12m4490|1681492123.0|investing|Can someone explain how paying 20 times earnings for 12% growth and 1% dividend makes sense in the long term?|"Hey everyone, 
 
I'm a bit confused about a potential investment opportunity (don't want to name specifically) and was hoping someone could help shed some light on it. 
 
The company in question has a P/E ratio of 20, 12% expected earnings growth (based on long time past performance), and a 1% average dividend payout (at a constant growth rate) over a 10 year period.

| Year Range | Earnings | Dividend | Total Earnings | Price per Earnings |
|------------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| 0-10       | 3.10     | 0.03     | 3.13           | 6.39               |
| 10-20      | 7.49     | 0.08     | 7.57           | 2.64               |
| 20-23      | 10.84    | 0.11     | 10.95         | 2.11               |
| 23-24      | 15.34    | 0.15     | 15.50         | 1.62               |
| 24-25      | 21.61    | 0.22     | 21.83         | 1.23               |
| 25-26      | 30.42    | 0.30     | 30.72         | 0.92               |
  
My question is, how does it make sense to pay 20 times earnings for this investment? The only way I would make money is if the P/E ratio remains the same in the future, which seems like a big gamble to me. Data shows on average, companies survived only 10-20Y
 
I understand the concept of compounding returns, but I'm not sure how to apply it to this situation. Could someone provide a numerical rationale to explain how this investment could potentially make sense in the long term?  

Thanks in advance for your help!

I’ll just cut to the chase. I’m currently a 19 year old E3 in the Air Force. Using Excel, I’ve set up a spending plan in regards to income versus expenses.

I figured out that I would like to allocate 15% of my income (after expenses) towards investing but I’m not quite sure where to start.

I have attended classes, and watched a lot of videos - so I have a very basic understanding of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and how those investment options actually work.

I know that I want to put some of my investment allocation into longer-term lower risk investments that will help aid in my finances after retirement (I also have a separate allocation for my 401(k)). But, I also know that a lot of people say to take risks early, so I would also like to find some investment opportunities that might be a little bit more high risk, or short term.

The problem is, I’m not sure how much of that 15% should go into which - and I haven’t determined what exactly I’d like to invest in for each of those. Should I invest in dividend ETFs or should I just buy single shares of companies in the Fortune 500 and wait 10 years?

For longer-term, should I invest in bonds - or should I save part of my investment allocation for real estate later on when the housing market inevitably crashes and I can buy low?

Just some things I’ve been thinking about, and was looking to get some general advice from people who are much smarter than me.

Like I said, I have very very rudimentary and basic knowledge. Very much a novice in the investing world.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!"|0.67|5|0|5|[]
t3_12kv023|1681403840.0|investing|LEAPS for Lifecycle Investing|"I have recently encountered the paper from Ayres and Nalebuff about lifecycle investing and leverage, and wanted to look at the feasibility of it in the current context.

Three options I am considering are:

\- using a leveraged ETF  
\- using margin investing: 7% on interactive brokers right now  
\- using LEAPS: buying long-term deep ITM call options.

I'm currently exploring this last option.

Say I want to expose myself to 100 shares of SPY. As time of writing, it trades at around $410 per share.

I could buy a call option with strike price $205 at expiry date March 2025 (two years from now), at a price of $217.

With a cost of $21,700, I am exposed to 100 shares of SPY, which makes me about 2x leveraged.

If the price of SPY remains the same until then, I should be able to sell by call options at $205, losing 6% of my investment.

In the worst case, SPY crumbles below $205, never recovers, and I lose the whole $21,700.

Is my understanding correct? Does that mean that using third strategy is equivalent to borrowing at an interest of \~3% per year?"|0.68|8|0|8|['Ayres']

I could have found a better graph for this, but this graph is sufficient in illustrating my point. My point is that GDP growth rates are persistently below their historical norms. Without being too specific, we used to see emerging economies grow at at 8% pa, and now they grow less than that. We used to see advanced economies grow at 2.5% to 3% pa, and now they grow less than that (about 1.5% to 2% pa).

Now, I'm generalising massively here, as of course some countries report crazy growth rates in specific years, and some countries in the 'advanced economies' or 'emerging economies' grouping persistently outperform their peers.

However, my point is: growth rates are lower across every generalizable category of economies whether it be emerging economies or advanced economies. 

What I want to know is; how will this impact returns on equities?

This is obviously a really complicated question, the relationship between asset price growth and productivity growth are not clear cut. However, I would \*think\* that if we could hold all else equal, that sustained lower productivity growth would mean lower investment returns.

What if in general, the worlds growth looked a \*little\* more like Japan's economic growth of the last 20 years? What would that mean for the returns on global equities?"|0.89|84|0|84|[]

For example, an I bond purchased in November 2021 will have the first interest payment with the new 3.38% rate on September 1st 2023. If purchased in March 2022, that would be January 1st 2024.

* The interest from I bonds are exempt from state and local taxes. Look at the tax equivalent yield when comparing to other investments. For example, the new rate starting in May 2023 will be 3.38%, and my state tax rate is 9.3%, so the tax equivalent yield is about 3.73%.
* Interest is tax deferred until the I bond is redeemed (unless you have purposely been reporting the interest on your tax return each year). You may want to hold off on selling during this year if you expect to be in a lower federal tax bracket in the following year.

I am wondering what to do in the case of an invasion China in Taiwan. I see two scenarios I would like to discuss.

1. China invades Taiwan and US are not intervene

In this case I think there will be a huge drop in all stocks initially. But to make it short I think some will recover quickly like military stuff. There will be market that don´t suffer too much like industrie that is not relying on the newest semi conductor chips. Companies like ASML and wafer producer which are not in taiwan can maybe take advantage of this situation and even grow since domestic demand of non involved countries will be huge. Nevertheless this is probably still a market you want to go rather short.

2. China invades Taiwan and US and its allies intervene.

This is actually the scenario why I opened this thread. For this scenario I am sure the global market will completely collapse. Health, Automotive, Chemical, the finance sector and with it most public companies who are relying on a cash flow so, even the steel industrie and sectors that  actually could profit from a WW3 scenario.   
Only, maybe, the military sector will give some gains here. But with the finance sector going down I assume military public companies will be made private and transfered to the GOV.   
Considering the global impact and the unpredictable behavior of supervisory authority like the SEC who could freeze the stock markets completly I think its not a bad idea to keep all money away from the stock market. I could also imagne collapses of currencies like the EU since the eurozone is already instable. But these are just some guesses.

Then one could argue go in Gold. But history has shown that states can use expropriation to take such investments away from one. Some voices say, and I think maybe they have a good point here, go to a unimportant emerging country that is used to be poor and stay there with your capital till the war is over.

What do you think would be the right investments strategy for these two scenarios and why exactly?"|0.32|0|0|0|[]

&gt;When KPMG LLP gave Silicon Valley Bank a clean bill of health just 14 days before the lender collapsed, the Big Four audit firm flagged potential losses on loans as a so-called critical audit matter. But the audit opinion was silent on what actually brought down the bank—its unrealized bond losses and ability to hold them given a reliance on potentially flighty deposits.

&gt;“The auditors failed to mention the fire in the basement or the box of dynamite on the first floor, but they did point out the peeling paint on the flower box,” said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor. “How could they miss the interest-rate risk?”

&gt;The current banking crisis is the first big test of critical audit matters, a measure designed to help investors decode risks and uncertainties buried in financial statements. 

&gt;Audit regulator Public Company Accounting Oversight Board introduced critical audit matters in 2017 to “breathe life into the audit report.” Described as the biggest shake-up in audits in 70 years, the new standard was meant to make audit opinions more useful to investors.

&gt;So far, though, critical audit matters have failed to shed light on issues that have caused a collapse of confidence among depositors and investors in many small and midsize banks.

&gt;Auditors are required to record any critical audit matters when they sign off on a public company’s books. Regulators define these as matters that have a significant impact on the financial statements and involve “especially challenging, subjective or complex” judgments by the auditors.

&gt;Silicon Valley Bank’s unrealized losses in its bond portfolio appear to “meet every definition of a possible critical audit matter,” said Martin Baumann, a former chief auditor at the PCAOB who had a leading role in designing the new measure.

&gt;The latest banking crisis has exposed the gamble some banks took in betting heavily on long-term government bonds, which last year plunged in value as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. 

&gt;Banks can keep these losses off their books by classifying their bondholdings as “held to maturity,” or intended never to be sold, allowing them to be held at cost rather than fair value. The banking industry last year relied more heavily on this accounting maneuver, as rising rates pummeled balance sheets.    

&gt;Accounting rules say banks can classify bonds as held to maturity only if they have both the intent and ability to hold on to them, rather than having to sell them to meet demands for withdrawals. For well-capitalized banks, that likely isn’t a tough judgment call to make.

&gt;But it is a much more nuanced issue for many of the lenders at the center of the latest banking crisis. Unlike the biggest banks, smaller banks are largely reliant on deposits for funding, which can prove flighty in stressed times, calling into question a bank’s ability to indefinitely hold long-term assets.

&gt;The parent of Silicon Valley Bank, SVB Financial Group SIVBQ had $91 billion of held-to-maturity bonds on its Dec. 31 balance sheet, which a footnote said had a fair value of just $76 billion. That $15 billion loss was big enough to wipe out most of the bank’s total equity of $16 billion at year-end.

&gt;The lender’s total deposits had shrunk from the previous year, its financial statements showed. What’s more, its reported cash was only around 8% of total deposits, heightening the risk it would need to sell long-term assets if significant numbers of its depositors left. 

&gt;That appears to tick all the boxes for the auditor to highlight this issue as a critical audit matter. “The judgment as to whether or not Silicon Valley Bank had the ability to hold these securities to maturity was certainly a complex question, it was material to investors, and it is hard to see how liquidity was not a matter for discussion with the audit committee,” said Mr. Baumann, who is also a former senior partner at Big Four audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. 

&gt;“I’m not the auditor of the bank and I don’t know if this [bonds issue] should have been included in the auditor’s report,” he added. “But as the lead author of the standard, this certainly is the kind of item that we had in mind for critical audit matters.”

&gt;Representatives of the accounting industry pushed back on suggestions auditors should have sounded the alarm ahead of the crisis. Dennis McGowan, vice president of professional practice at the Center for Audit Quality, said accounting standards don’t require companies to anticipate “extremely remote” scenarios in deciding whether they can classify bonds as held to maturity. 

&gt;“Some of what’s happened could not have been anticipated. Social media fueled the withdrawals from one bank, for example,” Mr. McGowan said. “Auditors don’t have a crystal ball to anticipate that kind of thing.”

&gt;KPMG’s audit of Silicon Valley Bank could be tested in court if shareholders decide to include the firm in the likely lawsuits. 

&gt;“The lack of a relevant critical audit matter and of a going concern are going to come up if it comes to litigation,” said Jack Castonguay, an accounting professor at Hofstra University. He added that it was difficult to judge KPMG’s audit without seeing the firm’s work papers or knowing what risks it discussed with SVB’s audit committee.

&gt;A KPMG spokesman declined to comment. In response to a request for comment to SVB’s successor bank, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve cited the regulator’s description of the bank’s failure as a “textbook case of mismanagement.” She declined to comment on KPMG’s audit of the lender. 

&gt;Do you think changes should or will be made to the way banks are audited as a result of the collapse of SVB and Signature? Join the conversation below.

&gt;Auditors’ apparent blind spot on the interplay of interest-rate and liquidity risks isn’t confined to Silicon Valley Bank. 

&gt;Auditors for nine other U.S. banks most exposed to bond losses also didn’t flag this as an issue when they signed off on the financial statements for 2022, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal

&gt;The Journal reviewed the audit opinions for the 10 small to midsize U.S. banks that last year reported the highest losses on held-to-maturity securities as a proportion of their shareholder equity, based on data from research-firm Calcbench. Silicon Valley Bank ranked second on the list. 

&gt;None of the auditors included a critical audit matter related to the bank’s treatment of the bonds. Instead, nine of the 10 reported a critical audit matter for estimated losses from loans or other bad debts. That is the risk that brought down banks in the 2008 financial crisis. Auditors didn’t report any critical audit matter for one of the banks, the analysis found.

&gt;A PCAOB spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the lack of critical audit matters related to the latest crisis was a reflection of the effectiveness of the measure. 

&gt;“Unfortunately CAMS have not been used as fully as we had hoped for,” the former regulator Mr. Baumann said."|0.88|282|0|282|['Silicon Valley Bank']

Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?

# Operations

First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.

* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts
* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion
* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.

The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.

# Competition

When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.

***US market***  
In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.

***Worldwide***  
In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.

***Total Payment Volume competition***  
Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.

# Financials metrics

We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?

To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.

Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:

* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%
* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%
* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%
* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%

Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.

# Analyst Expectations

Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:

* 18.33% in 2023
* 15.28% in 2024
* 13.07% in 2025

In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.

Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.

# Valuation

This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:

* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.
* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94
* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2
* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1
* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4

The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.

One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.

The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.

The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.

# Conclusion

Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.

What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?"|0.84|79|0|79|[]

The two reasons that I can think of that will force a Fed rate decrease are the following:  
1. March, April, May of last year showed significant month on month CPI increase. If the March, April, May reports of this year show a smaller month on month inflation, then the annualized CPI reading might fall down to 4%. This is still not in the 2% territory that Fed targets. But might be enough to pull back the rates by 50 bp or something maybe?

2. If the inflation falls down to below 5% rate and the Fed is paying 5.25% in interest, then people will say that Fed is contributing to the inflation? And that will force Fed to decrease the rates? Fed's rate cannot be more than the current inflation rate right?

You know the one I'm talking about: the one where you need to click a button to type in every character in your password, that also prevents auto-fill from password managers as well.

I am here to show you all how to fix this permanently (or at least until they change the website). As some of the more tech-savvy of you may know, the reason this input box is blocked from typing and autocomplete is because of the presence of a couple HTML attributes. If you right-click on the input box and inspect the element using dev tools, you'll see two attributes `readonly=""readonly""` and `autocomplete=""off""` attached to it. You can manually delete these (delete the entire attribute, not just the value on the right-hand side of the `=`) and then type in your password like a normal human being using your physical keyboard or password manager auto-fill.

However, the above solution, while an improvement, is very manual and can be kind of annoying to perform every single time. If you want to skip this altogether you need to set up an automated way to remove these attributes without manual intervention. Enter ""userscripts"": a convenient way to personally customize your browser experience by injecting custom javascript into a webpage. Download a userscript extension for your browser (the most popular one right now is [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) [download links for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), [safari?](https://github.com/OpenUserJS/OpenUserJS.org/wiki/Tampermonkey-for-Safari)]), create a new script, and copy/paste this into the editor and hit save:
```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         TreasuryDirect disable virtual keyboard
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  removes the stupid virutal keyboard requirement

(function() {
    'use strict';
    let pwInput = document.getElementById(""password"")
    pwInput.removeAttribute(""autocomplete"")
    pwInput.removeAttribute(""readonly"")
})();
```
This will basically perform the above attribute deletion steps for you automatically every time you load the webpage. No more dealing with the virtual keyboard. Happy investing!

Over the past 10-15 years, the increased presence of institutional investors and pricing technology has made it harder, although not impossible, to source opportunities and create above market returns within real estate. The increased sophistication of owners (previously ""mom and pop"", now investment firms) has allowed them to focus on maximizing net operating income, and therefore limiting operating inefficiencies. This has been most pronounced in the multifamily market.

t3_12gedn5|1681032215.0|investing|Recontextualizing the EMH to make it more intuitive|"EMH is not very controversial amongst the academics and (even) some great active fund managers, Howard Marks is an active manager yet in his books mastering the market cycle and the most important thing he agrees with basic tenets of it, yet there is so much confusion about in retail circles, and professional investors too. Bill Ackman seems to talk smack about it, and everyone talks about his “greatest trade ever” during COVID crash forgetting that he trailed the market massively, having pretty much flat returns during one of the greatest bulls runs ever in the 2010s.

A lot of the misunderstandings I think stem from the confusing wording and highly technical language, as well as some models of it, which even further confuse the readers. The theoretical perfect model definitions of it can easily be easily smacked with some exceptions to the rule, and yet the practical applications are powerful. Below are some examples of what I mean:

Weak and strong EMH and the idea of “priced in”. For one, I don’t know anyone who seriously believes in strong version of EMH. In his podcast, Ben Felix asked Eugene Fama what he thinks about the GameStop ordeal to which Eugene Fama replied that EMH is a model that approximates reality, and it is not an ideal representation of it, and just like in any other model, there will be some events that do not fit it. In other words, the technical definition of EMH overstates it’s predicting powers (when it doesn’t even reflect the views of its founding fathers), while also giving an unintuitive explanation 

Rationality of the markets. The issue with this is that rationality always becomes apparent in hindsight. It’s not immediately obvious how events will unfold, and only in retrospect it’s easy to say that the market acted irrationally. It was not immediately clear how covid would unfold, and the degree of the intervention of the CBs. In 2008 the fed let Lehman collapse which lead to a credit crunch. A panic sell at the time would have benefited the investor, and yet the entry point of march 2009 would have been nearly impossible to predict. In other words, EMH is not saying that irrationality as defined by 20/20 hindsight is not possible, just that it’s unlikely you will always be on the right side of the decision making.

Exceptions to the rule. Markets work on probabilities, and it’s not crazy to think that some investors could have beat the market. Then again, we have to define what the market is. Buffet is usually given as an example, but comparing his returns to SP500 is not exactly correct when he very clearly has a value and size tilt, which are integral to EMH. Many studies in fact show Buffet’s returns are in line when compared to the correct benchmarks. There are other examples too, like Jim Simmons who clearly demonstrates that at least some inefficiencies very likely exist in the market too, although it’s mportant to consider that we don’t actually know what he does, and that he uses up to 10x leverage. Still, some people will have an insight that the market has clearly missed out like Burry during 2008 housing crisis. EMH doesn’t make that an impossibility, just a high improbability (we’re still talking about it 15 years later)

This is why in multiple discussions with my friends and colleagues I have preferred to redefine EMH from: “market prices reflect all available information” to a much more practical and intuitive definition of: “it’s highly unlikely that anyone could beat their given benchmark on a risk adjusted basis”. After all, as shown above, being lucky, having a brilliant insight, leveraging yourself or factor tilting doesn’t disprove EMH. What EMH means is that without luck or insanely extraordinary skill (on par with one in millions) no one can beat the overall market without factor tilting or taking on more risk"|0.67|3|0|3|['EMH']

“Refinancing risks are front and center” for owners of properties from office buildings to stores and warehouses, Morgan Stanley analysts including James Egan wrote in a note this past week. “The maturity wall here is front-loaded. So are the associated risks.”

The investment bank estimates office and retail property valuations could fall as much as 40% from peak to trough, increasing the risk of defaults.

Adding to the headache, small and regional banks — the biggest source of credit to the industry last year — have been rocked by deposit outflows following the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, raising concerns that will crimp their ability to provide finance to borrowers.

I am a 28 year old male, married and I live in the SF Bay Area. I started working in 2020 and since then I have accumulated ~27k into my retirement account. My employer offers a  401k which is self-managed account. Beginning of this year I have started contributing $1000 every month and my employer contributes additional 3% (there is no matching and the contribution is fixed). So roughly speaking I would add 1400-1500/month to my 401k. 

Current strategy:
1) Since the interest rates are high I am buying short term (mostly 3m) t-bills with the cash I have (~$400/month)

2) I buy 3 VOO stocks between 15-20th of each month no matter what the price is (~$1100/month). Dividends are re-invested

3) I have 1 year CDs worth 10k @4.5% 

4) 10k spare cash (in case of black swans) this will keep growing over time.

Thoughts/Questions:
1) I don’t expect interest rates to stay above 4% forever and hence I would need an alternative to t-bills. I will continue only until t-bills return more than 4%. What do you guys recommend?

2) I need to diversify into ETFs outside USA. What are the top global ETFs or ex-USA ETFs? 

3) Should I invest into Gold/Silver funds? Never thought of it as a long term investment. 

4) Are there any other less risky retirement type investments that you could do within a 401k?

In order to average a 2.0% inflation rate across 15 years (the previous 10 plus the next 5), we'd have to get inflation to an annualized 1.54% for the next 5 years. If we allowed ourselves the next decade to bring the 20-year average down, we'd need roughly 1.75% over the next 10 years.

1.54% annualized would require 0.12% MoM readings. 1.75% annualized would require under 0.15% MoM readings.

So, when people are talking about inflation is going back the other way, and time to turn on the money printers, keep this in mind. If the Fed really cared about 2.0% PCE inflation, we'd be really tight for a long time.

Lately I have been studying how the US stock market usually reacts to changes in the Fed Funds rate.  I cannot post the chart here, but there is an interesting ""Fed Funds rate vs S&amp;P500"" chart available here: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2638/sp500-fed-funds-rate-compared](https://www.macrotrends.net/2638/sp500-fed-funds-rate-compared).  Looking at the ""All Years"" chart (70-years), a few of my takeaways are:  

1. Recessions are not uncommon over the long term.  There have been 10 recessions in the past 70 years (the 2-month recession in Feb/Mar 2020 is hard to see on the 70-yr chart due to scale).
2. Recessions are usually relatively short-lived, ranging from a few months to 1.5 years.
3. Recessions generally occur during periods of Fed Fund rate reduction.
4. During most Fed rate increases in recent history (30 yrs), the S&amp;P500 generally increases, while during Fed rate reductions, the S&amp;P500 generally decreases.
5. The current situation does not seem to be following this trend.  The Fed rate has been increasing since Mar 2022, and the S&amp;P500 has been decreasing over much of that time.

Questions: Why is the current situation different?  Could it be due to the faster Fed Fund rate of increase?  I realize that the S&amp;P500 has been ""overbought / high P/E ratio"" the past few years; perhaps that's also a factor.  What other macro factors may be affecting it?

&gt;US bank lending contracted by the most on record in the last two weeks of March, indicating a tightening of credit conditions in the wake of several high-profile bank collapses that risks damaging the economy.

&gt;Commercial bank lending dropped nearly $105 billion in the two weeks ended March 29, the most in Federal Reserve data back to 1973. The more than $45 billion decrease in the latest week was primarily due to a a drop in loans by small banks.

&gt;The pullback in total lending in the last half of March was broad and included fewer real estate loans, as well as commercial and industrial loans.
US Bank Lending Drops Dramatically | Bank lending fell by a record $104.7 billion in the last two weeks of March
 
 
&gt;Friday’s report also showed commercial bank deposits dropped $64.7 billion in the latest week, marking the 10th-straight decrease that mainly reflected a decline at large firms.

&gt;The slide in lending follows the collapse of several firms including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

&gt;Economists are closely monitoring the Fed’s so-called H.8 report, which provides an estimated weekly aggregate balance sheet for all commercial banks in the US, to gauge credit conditions. The recent bank failures have complicated the central bank’s efforts to reduce inflation without sending the economy into a recession.

&gt;On Thursday, the American Bankers Association index of credit conditions fell to the lowest level since the onset of the pandemic, indicating bank economists see credit conditions weakening over the next six months. As a result, banks are likely to become more cautious about extending credit.

&gt;The banking crisis has made a recession more likely, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Jamie Dimon. The bank’s chief executive officer said in an annual letter that the failures have “provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more conservative.”

&gt;The Fed’s report showed that by bank size, lending decreased $23.5 billion at the 25 largest domestically chartered banks in the latest two weeks, and plunged $73.6 billion at smaller commercial banks over the same period. Lending by foreign institutions in the US fell $7.5 billion.

&gt;The biggest 25 domestic banks account for almost three-fifths of lending, although in some key areas — including commercial real estate — smaller banks are the most important providers of credit.

&gt;In a note on the report, the Fed said domestically chartered banks made divestments to nonbank institutions that affected $60 billion in loans in the week ended March 22, meaning those loans are no longer held by commercial lenders.

&gt;Meanwhile, so-called “other” deposits, which exclude large time deposits, have fallen $260.8 billion at commercial banks since the week ended March 15. At domestically chartered banks, they declined $236 billion, mostly reflecting a drop at the 25 largest institutions. Deposits at small banks fell $58.1 billion.

&gt;Two-Week Changes:

&gt;Commercial and industrial lending — considered a closely &gt;Commercial real estate loans dropped $35.3 billion
&gt;Total assets, which includes vault cash, as well as balances due from depository institutions and the Fed, decreased nearly $220 billion
&gt;Total liabilities declined more than $188 billion

t3_12ffq8h|1680942189.0|investing|Has the Time to Buy Bonds Finally Arrived? [Discussion]|"**For context, I am based in the UK and I'm 27 so I'm looking at this through a long-term lens.**

I started seriously investing in mid-2019 and since then, I've always thought that bonds did not really offer that good of a risk/reward ratio. Obviously, bonds skyrocketed in 2020 once interest rates were cut down since price obviously moves opposite to yield. We saw possibly the most expensive bonds ever in the UK, US and EU.

Since then, I've actively avoided bonds and only had a veeery tiny exposure for monitoring purposes. However, now, it seems that we may be hitting the bottom for bond prices. The Federal Reserve have signaled they will most likely avoid raising rates further or, at most, do another couple of raises of up to 6% at the most (even that may be unlikely given the banking situation). The Bank of England is in a slightly different situation, but I imagine they won't be raising rates that much higher either as things will simply start breaking.

My point here is this: bonds are starting to offer returns comparable to stocks (in my eyes). Up until now, my investment allocation in my ISA (*for those not in the UK, this is basically an investment vehicle which allows you to invest up to £20,000 every year tax-free, e.g. capital gains and dividends received there are not taxable*) is around 90% stocks, 7% gold and 3% bonds. I use Moneybox (a passive investing ISA app) so the 2 bond funds (both are denominated in GBP, too) available to me are:

* [iShares Overseas Government Bonds](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B849C803-ishares-overseas-govt-bnd-index-d-acc/key-statistics)
* [iShares Overseas Corporate ESG Bonds](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B58YKH53-ishares-esg-overseas-corp-bd-index-d-acc/key-statistics)

I'm considering putting 20-25% of all my **future contributions** (I won't be selling any existing positions) to these bonds with 15% to government and 5-10% to corporate bonds. The way I see it is that if we're approaching the end of the rate hike cycle for the Fed/BoE/ECB, then prices of bonds will soon start to rise and, even if they don't, then the yield will still be good enough to keep them around. Plus, the longer rates stay higher, the bigger dividend these funds will start paying as they will be able to buy/replace more notes/bonds with higher coupon rates.

Obviously, sticky inflation and other issues can change that. There is also talk of potential debt defaults and all that - we've seen the bank problems recently, but I don't know how much of this is FUD and how much is really possible. To me, the default risk is really the highest which is why I want to buy more government bonds since I don't think they will default - they may print more money and increase inflation, but the default is off the table (in my eyes).

What are your thoughts on bonds right now? Is it worth buying \[more of\] them? Am I missing something really obvious here?"|0.78|23|0|23|[]

They are nearing retirement (~10yrs away). I recommended they reach out to a financial advisor to determine how best to utilize their remaining balance. Given their lower risk appetite the advisor recommended reinvesting in VOO and just letting the 70k sit and grow over time. Our friend has a 401k thankfully but still thinks a more active approach is best. I’ve also recommended that they invest in VOO and step away from trying to beat the market. What are your thoughts for this strategy? Is it wishful thinking to presume they could recover their losses over the next 5-10 yrs via an ETF?


Edit: 
I’d like to thank you all for your thoughtful responses. I shared this post and the other in /stocks with him and he’s decided to finally listen. Next steps is interviewing a couple more fee only financial advisors (that are fiduciaries) and he’s agreed to stop and let them handle his portfolio moving forward. For those asking about retirement, he has a 401k that has roughly ~600k in it but this loss in particular was tough because it was his “liquid savings” outside of a modest emergency fund. Given the plan to retire in 10 years, he recognizes the damage and is going to work with an advisor to build a realistic investment strategy to maximize returns in the interim."|0.81|106|0|106|[]

I am holding because the space industry is relatively new, and has potentially massive future marketcap in the future.

They collect revenue from payment from launches, and offer subscriptions for maintenance of satellites launched.

Admittedly these guys are not yet profitable, so I recognize I overpaid at their SPAC pricing of $10/share.

&gt;When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month, the core problem was a giant hole in its bond portfolio. When depositors started fleeing First Republic Bank pointing triangle soon afterward, the concern mainly was about a hole in its loan book.

&gt;Nearly every publicly traded bank in the country is sitting on loans that have declined in value since they were made. The culprit is rising interest rates, which also slashed the value of banks’ other big asset, their holdings of securities. 

&gt;The overall market-value losses on securities are well known because they are tallied up industrywide by banking regulators. The scale of market-value losses on loans made by publicly traded banks has to be tallied from banks’ securities filings.

&gt;“Fair values of loans and securities are not qualitatively different,” said Tom Linsmeier, an accounting professor at the University of Wisconsin and former member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. “They measure the same amount: the price at which the asset can be sold in an orderly transaction in the market today.”

&gt;**First Republic’s balance sheet showed $166.1 billion of loans as of Dec. 31, at amortized cost. A footnote said their fair-market value was $143.9 billion. The $22.2 billion difference was greater than First Republic’s $17.4 billion of total equity, or assets minus liabilities.**

&gt;The bank was seen by investors as risky because most of its loans at year-end were home mortgages with fixed or hybrid rates, meaning their low rates would stay fixed for one to 10 years. It also had $4.8 billion in unrealized losses on bonds. About 68% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end, meaning they exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. limits, which created greater flight risk. In that respect, it was similar to Silicon Valley Bank, which estimated that 88% of its deposits were uninsured. 

&gt;First Republic bought itself time last month after a group of 11 banks led by JPMorgan Chase deposited $30 billion to halt the run. While the deposits helped liquidity, they didn’t boost First Republic’s capital. A First Republic spokesman declined to comment.

&gt;While First Republic is an extreme example, it isn’t alone. Among 435 publicly traded U.S. banks listed on major exchanges, 97% of them reported that their loans’ market value was less than their balance-sheet amount as of Dec. 31, according to data provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

&gt;Combined, they had $242 billion of unrealized losses on their loans, defined as the difference between the loans’ fair values and carrying amounts. That was equivalent to 14% of their total equity and 21% of their tangible common equity, which is a widely used measure of net worth that excludes preferred stock and intangible assets.

&gt;A year earlier, the same banks said their loans’ fair value exceeded their carrying amount by $96 billion, the data show. The same group showed $299 billion of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities as of Dec. 31. Those losses aren’t included on companies’ balance sheets.

&gt;The unrealized losses on loans and securities likely fell at many banks in recent weeks as Treasury yields declined. The lower yields signal that investors think the economy is slowing. If they are right, then borrowers could start to fall behind on their loans, adding to losses on bank balance sheets.

&gt;Banks reporting large fair-value discounts on their loans could face earnings or liquidity pressure. They could face pressure to pay higher rates for deposits and other funding sources, while yields on fixed-rate loans they own stay low. “If liquidity issues arise for these banks, they may need either to issue additional debt capital at higher interest rates or to sell those loans to become more liquid,” Mr. Linsmeier said.

&gt;**The 435 banks in The Wall Street Journal’s sample included 100 where the combined unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities were equivalent to 50% or more of their total equity.**

&gt;**Bank of Hawaii Corp. in its most recent annual report said it had $985 million of unrealized losses on loans and $799 million of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities, as of Dec. 31. The combined $1.8 billion total exceeded Bank of Hawaii’s $1.3 billion of total equity. The company estimated that 52% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end. A Bank of Hawaii spokeswoman declined to comment.**

&gt;**Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp. reported $3.9 billion and $177 million of unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities, respectively, as of Dec. 31. By comparison, the company had $5.4 billion of total equity. Western Alliance estimated that 55% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end.**

&gt;**Western Alliance this week filed disclosures showing updated fair-value and deposit figures. Unrealized losses for loans and held-to-maturity securities had declined to $2.9 billion and $139 million, respectively, as of March 31. Deposits were $47.6 billion, down 11% since Dec. 31, while the uninsured-deposit ratio fell to 32%.**

&gt;Dale Gibbons, Western Alliance’s chief financial officer, in an email said, “Western Alliance has access to significant liquidity from a variety of sources, including pledging loans to secure credit facilities, which mitigates need to sell assets and realize adverse asset marks.” He said the company doesn’t need to raise capital.

&gt;**CVB Financial Corp., based in Ontario, Calif., reported $919 million and $399 million of unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities, respectively, as of Dec. 31. Combined, those were equivalent to 68% of its total equity, and they exceeded its tangible common equity. CVB estimated 65% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end.**

&gt;CVB’s chief executive officer, David Brager, said the bank’s deposit relationships remain strong and often span decades. “We haven’t had significant relationships that have expressed concern,” he said. He noted the bank has grown slowly and doesn’t have any large industry concentrations comparable to Silicon Valley Bank’s tech-heavy focus.

&gt;CVB’s chief financial officer, Allen Nicholson, said “most likely those unrealized losses have diminished somewhat” since year-end, because rates declined.

&gt;Systemically important banks have an advantage over smaller banks, because they are widely perceived as too big to fail and implicitly backed by the government. Consequently, they may continue to attract low-cost deposits and retain uninsured deposits at the expense of smaller competitors, even if their disclosures show they have large capital holes on a fair-value basis."|0.95|532|0|532|['Silicon Valley Bank']
t3_12ehpy6|1680866019.0|investing|Questions about internal taxation of ETFs|"Hello fellow investors. I've been wondering:

When an ETF receives dividends/coupons from the underlying companies or bonds, does the ETF itself pay withholding tax? 

When an ETF buys and sells assets, does the ETF itself pay any tax on profits? 

These may be important considerations, since as investors we are liable to taxation when receiving dividends or selling our ETFs at a profit. As such if the ETF itself paid taxes, then we would suffer double-taxation - in this case it would be more tax-efficient to own shares directly.

I would guess the quality of life increases because people are able to spend their money on other things. GDP would be around the same if the money goes to other sectors and global company earnings as a whole will be shifted between sectors but not increase.
